1
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:44,920
Hi. I'm leaving earlier than expected.

2
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,920
I'm going to Rome today. Company things.

3
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,640
Can you stay with Bruno?

4
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:53,320
It's only three weeks prior to what we agreed.

5
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,560
Hell! Let's sit down.

6
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:11,160
Three weeks is no big deal. Bring Bruno today.

7
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:14,120
I wasn't expecting him yet, but whatever. I'll get used to it.

8
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:15,360
No, I'll talk to my parents.

9
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,040
He'll stay there until you're ready to take care of your son.

12
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,120
In three weeks, my parents will take him to you. I'll call them.

13
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,680
Hey, that annoying dog was licking my shoe.

14
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,280
You know how much that pisses me off.

15
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,680
I almost gave his owner a piece of my mind,

16
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,600
but I didn't because I knew you were coming

17
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,440
and I wanted you to see that I can control myself.

18
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,280
I will control myself with Bruno, too,

19
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,760
even if you're worried I won't take good care of him.

20
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:47,880
-I do worry. -Yeah, right.

21
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,720
But you worry less when you're in good company, right?

22
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,880
I don't have a boyfriend in Rome and do not butt in my life.

23
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:57,720
Is it so hard to tell the truth?

24
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,320
His name is Salvatore.

25
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:06,400
Do not tell Bruno. Work has nothing to do with him.

26
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,120
But he helped you find the job.

27
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,400
They didn't give me a position like this here.

28
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,600
-I have things to prepare. -Will you send the child support?

29
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,000
I never failed my son.

30
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,040
Damn!

31
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,400
Hey, listen.

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,560
Can you make man's fucking best friend shut up once and for all?

33
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,830
Tell Bruno his room will be ready.

34
00:02:30,830 --> 00:02:32,400
I'll wait for him at home, 3pm.

35
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,320
-All right, three o'clock. Bye. -Bye.

37
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,960
When they told you to do an eviction, you must've thought,

38
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,880
"Damn, how boring," Right?

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,440
No, don't worry. I've known for a long time.

40
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:04,760
I would eventually have to live with my mom.

41
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,920
So, come in. This city is really great.

42
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:09,100
There are places for tourists,

43
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,320
but not for the people who live here.

44
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:39,440
You are going to your dad's house today.

45
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,720
-That's awesome news. -Bruno!

46
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:44,680
No! I could've had more luck: broken a leg and won at bingo.

47
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,600
Deep down, you guys are alike.

48
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,720
Don't worry about the dance classes. I'll pay for them.

49
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:53,320
Wow, what a change. You always opposed.

50
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,840
Bruno!

51
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,640
Your job must be very good.

52
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:58,840
Yes, it is. And I had a hard time accepting it.

53
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,760
-What? -You got a boyfriend. I saw your phone.

54
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,400
You looked at my cell phone?

55
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:07,680
Going to Rome for such a shitty job would be weird.

56
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,920
-It's not a shitty job! -As if it were something normal.

57
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:13,840
I asked you to come with me.

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,800
I can do without Roman adventures.

59
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,360
I can't go if you're angry.

60
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,520
When you get to Rome, maybe I'll be OK.

62
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,560
Wait a minute.

63
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,680
They evicted you.

64
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Go ahead. Yes, yes.

65
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,640
But... Yes.

66
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,360
Yes!

67
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,800
Look, how old is the director?

68
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:10,080
Twenty-seven? Oh, tell him something for me.

69
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,320
When he was born, I was playing Antigone on stage.

70
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:16,560
I'm not an unknown actress! I'm the Calduch!

71
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,720
Tell me later. I love you!

72
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,840
Agents!

73
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:28,440
You rejected a job that would pay your rent.

74
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,120
I won't do anything but teach.

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,600
And Bruno? Wasn't he going to live with you?

76
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,240
The three of us here.

78
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,200
And I need to tame that director's ego.

79
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,360
He does Hamlet

80
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,560
with characters in military attire and thinks he's an innovator.

81
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,640
I like Bruno.

82
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,960
He's got talent.

83
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,860
Just one thing. He thinks

84
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,240
you work and doesn't know you were evicted.

85
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:03,560
Tell him the truth or you guys won't live here.

86
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:03,080
The peripatetic

87
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,040
Twenty minutes late.

88
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,600
The first "Merlinade."

89
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,960
I'm going to miss you.

90
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:15,320
Are you sure?

91
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:17,560
Of course.

92
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,760
Why do you change plans like this?

93
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,080
I would've arrived later if we'd gone to my house.

94
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,880
The meeting lasted longer than expected. What do you want?

95
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:30,240
-What? -Hi.

97
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:33,680
It's a joke, woman.

98
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,800
I'm sure we'll get along great. Yes or no?

99
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,360
Do I have to answer?

100
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,880
-You're walking with all this stuff? -Cab!

101
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,680
Thank you.

102
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,480
-Bye, sweetheart. -You're not going to cry.

103
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,680
If you hug me, no.

104
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,960
-Come on. Bye. -Bye.

105
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,080
Go or you'll miss the plane.

106
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,640
Yes.

107
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,240
-Stop, stop, stop. -What's up?

108
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,000
-Nothing. We must get out. Sorry. -What?

109
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,520
Let's get your bags. Get out.

110
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,840
What are you doing?

111
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,960
We have to save money, kid.

112
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,600
Can you try a little harder not to embarrass me?

113
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:46,600
I'm crazy!

114
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,920
Save your energy. You're going to go really crazy.

115
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:11,160
You fooled mom and me.

116
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,600
You have no home and no work. What now? Are we going to a hotel?

117
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:19,040
Bruno, I don't want problems. I want solutions.

118
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,000
Do you know why we came here?

119
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,320
Is this the solution? Living with the Calduch's?

120
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:26,600
It's chaos!

121
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:29,120
Hey! I am the only one who can be dramatic.

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,980
-You're at my place. I'm in charge.

123
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:32,560
-What? I'm in charge of my son.

124
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,560
There's no choice but to adapt.

125
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:37,400
No, sorry. Mom hasn't boarded the plane yet.

126
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,480
You know why I didn't pay rent for a year?

127
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,920
Because child support was my priority.

128
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,760
Your father can make a lot of mistakes, but he didn't fail you.

129
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,880
If mom finds out, she won't let me stay here.

130
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,960
-Don't tell her. -Let him.

131
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,240
-What do you mean? -He can do what he wants.

132
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,760
-Shut up! -You shut up!

133
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:55,200
Do you really want to ruin her trip?

134
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,600
You know she has a boyfriend there?

135
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,600
I don't care.

136
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,600
I don't feel like wasting my time arguing with a kid.

137
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,960
He says that for me.

138
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
Yes?

139
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,360
Yes, it's me.

140
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,080
Mom, we did not go to dad's place.

141
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,000
We came to grandma's house. What are you doing?

142
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:30,360
Shut up. I just got called. I got a job.

143
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,000
-Oh, you got a job! -What job?

144
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:36,360
Damn, son. Don't you remember? I'm a teacher.

145
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:39,120
Liar. You don't have a job. You're making this up!

146
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,680
You're giving me a headache.

147
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:45,200
That's your brain trying to understand your nonsense.

148
00:10:45,280 --> 00:10:46,520
He's right.

149
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:49,120
-If you're lying... -I got a job.

150
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:50,800
All right.

151
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:57,560
Son, it's a lie, isn't it?

152
00:10:57,640 --> 00:10:58,870
No, the school called me.

153
00:10:58,870 --> 00:11:01,200
I'm going to be a substitute. I start tomorrow.

154
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,280
You don't look very happy.

156
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:46,000
How are you? I'm Toni, principal and Math teacher.

157
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,480
-How are you? -Welcome.

158
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:49,760
The last teacher got sick and will be on leave.

159
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:53,440
-OK, I can't say I'm sorry. -You will tutor our freshmen.

160
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:56,360
Tutor? Damn! So, I get to charge more,

161
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,720
and I can go out for pizza every now and then.

162
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,960
-I'll introduce you to the teachers. -Do you have to?

163
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,080
-Oh, of course. -The usual drag.

164
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:09,320
Gloria, the Art and Drawing teacher.

166
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:15,520
And Santi, her husband. Santi is the Spanish teacher.

167
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,960
-Nice to meet you. -Likewise.

168
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:19,840
We are married, but it doesn't look like it, right?

169
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,800
-Shut up! Come on. -Excuse me.

170
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,320
And Eugeni Bosch, head of staff, Catalan Language and Literature.

171
00:12:29,400 --> 00:12:30,400
How's it going?

172
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,160
Welcome to the trenches. Are you the new Aristotle?

173
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,840
It was sung that Philosophy would be undervalued by all.

174
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,320
I was the first to post an article about it.

175
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,600
Interesting.

176
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:45,520
No, no. Eugeni has a blog on literature. It's okay.

177
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,400
I could interview you for the blog.

178
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,360
It'd be nice to talk about philosophy.

180
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,400
-How are you? -Hello. A pleasure.

181
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,560
Mireia is one of the promises of the school.

182
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:00,960
That's a bit much.

183
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,080
No, no, no. You're a diamond in the rough.

184
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:04,560
If you let yourself be advised,

185
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,280
you will end up being a great teacher.

186
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,160
Is there a toilet near or do I vomit right here?

187
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,360
Here are the schedules. Cheer up. Good luck on your first day!

188
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,680
Thank you.

189
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,040
-Hello, everyone. -Hello!

190
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,960
Hi.

191
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,720
I'm late.

192
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,440
I had to go to the vet. My dog was bad all night, poor thing.

193
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:31,920
-Hello. -Hello.

194
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,560
I had a really bad time. Gloria, do you have my photocopies?

195
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,360
-Yes. Here they are. -Thank you.

198
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,960
I like that name. I'm Laia, from English.

199
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:54,600
-I'm late for class. Bye. -Bye.

200
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,440
I'm sorry, but she's with Albert, the Phys Ed teacher.

201
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,520
I'm going. I have a freshman class.

202
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,400
What a way to start! Beware of Pol Rubio.

203
00:14:10,640 --> 00:14:14,320
He's rude. Never takes notes. He flunked two years.

204
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,440
You will recognize him because he's always kissing Berta Prats.

205
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,960
Good luck.

206
00:15:01,160 --> 00:15:03,440
Joan, do you have any pens left?

207
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,800
-Did I give you back the other one? -It does not matter.

208
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:20,040
Bruno.

209
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,040
-I'm so lucky. -Why?

210
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,050
I was going to live with my father,

211
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:25,720
but will live with my grandmother, too.

212
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,120
-Good heavens! -Bruno, my friend!

213
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:32,240
Why did you miss class yesterday? Were you sick?

214
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:34,760
Kind of. Yes.

215
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,480
-Today is the new Philosophy, right? -Yes.

216
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,400
-The new one of Philosophy? -The substitute.

217
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:44,600
What's up?

218
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,000
Nothing. It doesn't matter.

219
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:10,320
Good morning, kids!

220
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,720
He's my father!

221
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,840
-Seriously? Is he your... -Shut up!

223
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:28,280
and I want you to get turned on by Philosophy.

224
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,400
-Marc is turned on every day. -Shut up, you idiot!

225
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,310
That is, I intend to

226
00:16:35,310 --> 00:16:37,560
contaminate you with my interest in Philosophy.

227
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:40,200
You. What's your name?

228
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,760
-Bruno. -Bruno what?

229
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,400
Bergeron.

230
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,240
Be... Ber... What kind of last name is that?

231
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,800
It's French.

232
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,320
Do you think Philosophy is good for anything?

233
00:16:55,240 --> 00:16:58,120
-Yes. -That's what I wanted to hear.

234
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,360
I'm sick of people saying that Philosophy is useless.

235
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:07,680
It seems the educational system forgot the questions,

236
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,120
who are we? Where do we come from? Where are we going to?

237
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,380
Now all that matters is what company we open,

238
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,760
how much money we'll make.

239
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,080
Philosophy serves to ponder, to ponder about life,

240
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,080
about the human being.

241
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,760
And to question things.

242
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,600
Maybe that's why they want it eliminated, right?

243
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:30,080
They find it dangerous.

244
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,840
Philosophy and power have an unresolved sexual tension.

245
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,960
What is Philosophy?

246
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,600
-No idea, right? -Nope.

247
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:46,400
Philosophy is not just a set

248
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:49,240
of deep questions and absolute truths.

249
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:53,800
Philosophy is turning upside down everything we take for granted.

250
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,240
Good heavens, everyone with such a confused expression.

251
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,720
Not everyone, huh?

252
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,480
Contrary to what many people think, teenagers are not stupid.

253
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,360
-He is. -Don't rat me out, eh?

254
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,760
What happens is that they are asleep.

255
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,960
They don't lift their ass unless their mobile is taken from them.

256
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,360
I want to see you awake,

257
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,800
with your antennae on, attentive to what happens around you.

258
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,600
Ready to take on contradictions and doubts that life poses.

259
00:18:25,720 --> 00:18:27,800
And to face adversities.

260
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:32,920
And, above all, since we don't always win in this life,

261
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,640
to learn from defeats.

262
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:38,680
I know a little about this subject.

263
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,790
Yesterday, for example,

264
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,960
they threw me out of the apartment I had rented.

265
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,520
Yes, yes! They kicked me out because I did not pay!

266
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,120
What a nerve, right?

267
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:53,360
You and I have two things in common, now that I think about it.

268
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:56,440
We live at mom's house and we do not have a euro.

269
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,880
And you say it so calmly, as if it did not affect you.

270
00:18:59,960 --> 00:19:01,840
What do you want me to do? Should I cry?

271
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,240
No, I'd rather laugh at adversity.

272
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
Come on, tell me some personal problem laughing.

273
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:11,360
Who wants to start?

274
00:19:15,920 --> 00:19:17,920
-You. Tell me, what's your name? -Tania.

275
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,320
All right, Tania.

276
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:23,200
My father was caught cheating the treasury.

277
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:27,240
-Yes, girl! -I swear. Now he has to pay a fine.

278
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,390
It's just that my father doesn't

279
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:29,840
know how to lie, he's sloppy. I don't know.

280
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,240
-Give him my best regards. -Right.

281
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,760
Not bad, but I ask you about you.

282
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,080
Come on, kids. Who wants to share?

283
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:40,520
Who else is encouraged? Come on, come on. You!

284
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:45,520
My name is Joan Capdevila and my problem is...

285
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,160
Well, I don't know if it's a problem, but I'm very shy.

286
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,960
-Yeah. But tell me that laughing. -I'm very shy.

287
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,200
But you raised your hand to speak in front of everyone.

288
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,280
You're not that shy.

289
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,560
Anyone else?

290
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,640
Tell me.

291
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:09,560
Always... Well, my name is Gerard.

292
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:15,000
I always like some girl, but they never look at me.

293
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:19,320
-Why could it be? -How do you know? Do you read thoughts?

294
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:22,320
This school may have

295
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,760
some girl who thinks of you every night before going to bed.

296
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,160
Come on, now me!

297
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:34,920
I do not take notes. I'm telling you, so you know.

298
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:38,260
I can't listen and write at the same time.

299
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:40,600
And no teacher understands it.

300
00:20:40,680 --> 00:20:44,240
No. I do understand. Look, in Philosophy, you just have to listen

301
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,120
and learn to think.

302
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:49,200
I don't care if you don't take notes, Pol Rubio.

303
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:51,760
How do you know my name?

304
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,560
They told me you like to

305
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,480
study so much you usually do the courses twice.

306
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,680
Looks like you do not know him.

307
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:10,200
-It's not that... -OK.

308
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,960
I don't know him. I don't know.

309
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:14,360
-Yeah. -I cannot say the same.

310
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,200
Bergeron. Just a moment.

311
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,680
You should be happy. You see, I have a job. It was true.

312
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,040
Now you'll see how your father teaches.

313
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:27,160
-You asked for a job at my school. -No. This goes by number.

314
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,880
I cannot give up this position or I am deleted from the lists.

315
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:33,600
That's shitty. You giving me classes and mom in Rome with a guy.

316
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,600
She went to Rome to work, not to fuck.

317
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:37,720
Couldn't you delete the word "Fuck"?

318
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,200
And here. Mom will hallucinate when I tell her I'm going to her.

319
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:43,320
I will save and will look for an apartment.

320
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:46,590
It was enough to see you twice a month.

321
00:21:46,590 --> 00:21:48,480
Now it's every day and as a teacher.

322
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,120
It is not my ideal as a teenager.

323
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:53,280
-Bruno. -What?

324
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:57,040
When I was a child, I left you and your mother. It's true.

325
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,960
I made a mistake. Don't you ever make mistakes?

326
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:03,960
Now I would like to help you not to make too many mistakes.

327
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:07,680
It's been years that I see you only a couple of weekends a month.

328
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,480
When your mom told me that she was going to Rome and that...

329
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:12,920
I had to stay with you, I was glad.

330
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:16,960
Yes, I know I am really used to going around free,

331
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,720
but I would like to live with you.

332
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,800
Dad, are you getting sentimental or what?

333
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,690
I'll leave you my room.

334
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:28,640
It's bigger than the one supposed to be yours.

335
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,800
If you want to be more relaxed, we won't say that I'm your dad.

336
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,640
I don't know how long it will take for them to know, but, yes.

337
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:39,280
We'd rather not say anything.

338
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:44,600
It's just that, dad, you're weird.

339
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,960
Everything okay?

340
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:52,440
-I do not like this mobile. -Okay, I'll buy you one.

341
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,040
Good.

342
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,650
What the fuck is this

343
00:22:58,650 --> 00:23:01,200
adolescence that a father is worth a mobile?

344
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,480
Nothing. The vet did some tests and it's all fine.

345
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,800
After the night I spent, at least this makes me happy.

346
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:13,040
-Maybe she ate something bad. -I suppose.

347
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:15,360
Do you want me to come by your house today?

348
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,600
I'm very tired. I didn't sleep at all last night.

349
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,080
As you wish.

350
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:24,080
Well, come on. Will you stay over to sleep?

351
00:23:24,520 --> 00:23:25,560
Yes.

352
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,560
How are you?

353
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:31,080
-Hello. How was the first class? -Good, very good.

354
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:33,720
Look, let me introduce you to Albert, of Physical Education.

356
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,320
-How are you? -Hello.

357
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:40,480
I'm going, or I'll be late for class.

358
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:41,840
-Fine. -See you later.

359
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,760
-Very well. -Bye.

360
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,920
-Is he your boyfriend? -Yes.

361
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:49,440
-How old is he? -Twenty-seven.

362
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:54,440
You are attractive to be with someone older and more experienced.

363
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:56,840
Why do you say that to me?

364
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:00,680
It's nothing. I didn't mean to bother you. See you around.

365
00:24:12,520 --> 00:24:14,600
If he's talking to Joan, I don't know why...

366
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:16,560
He's a bitter one.

367
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:19,720
I couldn't stand David. I went to talk to him once...

368
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:20,800
He was an imbecile.

369
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,640
I looked for him in his office and you simply can't talk to him.

370
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,960
-He got serious, didn't he? -A lot!

371
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,760
You can't talk to him. Jeez!

373
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,520
At first I thought: "He's delirious". But then I liked him.

374
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,840
-He's worse than fat Santi. -No way! I like Santi.

375
00:24:38,040 --> 00:24:39,640
The class seemed interesting to me.

376
00:24:42,520 --> 00:24:45,360
-What's up? -Tutorials seem interesting to you.

377
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,040
What are you doing, man?

379
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:51,000
before coming to class. He sniffed glue.

380
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:53,320
I told him I don't take notes and he understood me.

381
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,280
-I understand you, my love. -Don't call me that way.

382
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:58,160
Stupid.

383
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,680
Do you want some grass?

384
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:03,560
It's going to fall on the food.

386
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:09,400
-What did you say? -Come on, shut up.

387
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:12,360
He's serious.

388
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,720
-You don't have a father. -Of course I do.

389
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:18,120
He asked your last name.

390
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,120
Yeah. And he laughed at your last name. Bergeron.

391
00:25:22,360 --> 00:25:25,240
-Right. It was a joke. -Tania, whatever.

392
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,160
There's this guy, who goes to guitar classes with me,

393
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:29,520
who was so excited that he took a melon,

394
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:33,360
-put it in the microwave, made a hole... -No!

395
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,880
Then, pumba, pumba, pumba!

396
00:25:35,960 --> 00:25:37,680
-He gave it all! -That's disgusting, man.

397
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,040
A guy, you say?

398
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,360
Why are all melons bored at your place?

399
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:44,040
No way! That's a lie!

401
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,480
Yes?

402
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:53,160
Hey, I didn't understand what you said about my boyfriend.

403
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:56,800
-Can you explain it to me? -Yes, I said he was very young.

404
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,560
I was surprised. Attractive women such as yourself usually go out

405
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,920
with more mature and experienced men.

406
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:04,680
Like you, perhaps?

407
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,640
I won't allow you to follow that path.

408
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:08,810
You've just arrived and I

409
00:26:08,810 --> 00:26:10,680
didn't give you motive to try and seduce me.

410
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:14,000
-Is that clear? -Transparent.

411
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,040
Really, you're very gorgeous.

412
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,840
-But how dare you? -Are you insulted?

413
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,560
Is it so strange that I tell you what I think? I am like that.

414
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,440
When a woman attracts me, I say it.

415
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:26,640
And that doesn't mean that I want something more.

416
00:26:27,080 --> 00:26:29,680
I just show my admiration for beauty.

417
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,480
-Thanks but no... -But no, nothing.

418
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:34,710
You're beautiful and that's it.

419
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,200
It won't hurt anyone to say so, will it?

420
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:39,200
I'm complaining about the tone.

421
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:42,200
The tone? The tone was correct. Sincere, but correct.

422
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,680
Look, whatever. Forget it.

424
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,680
Sure! Did you see the curriculum was not necessary?

425
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:55,880
I love you!

426
00:26:56,960 --> 00:27:00,320
-Will you help me memorize the text? -Where is dad?

427
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:04,200
I think he won't come late. Do you like your bedroom?

428
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,840
I always dreamed of sleeping close to dad and grandma.

429
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:08,840
You'll get used to it quickly.

430
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:10,880
Yeah. Classes, not so much.

431
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:14,480
Yes, it's better that parents don't be their children's teachers.

432
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,000
-I'll take it stoically. -Poor thing.

433
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:21,000
Stoically. A word Dad put in my head.

434
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:24,400
Everything fine in Rome! And you?

435
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,800
It couldn't be better.

436
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:29,040
I'll call you tomorrow. Take care.

437
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:31,280
Okay.

438
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,040
-Don't you want some fruit? -No, I am not hungry.

439
00:27:36,680 --> 00:27:37,840
-Hello. -Hello!

440
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,000
-How did it go? -All right.

441
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,040
-Do you want to have dinner, son? -Yes.

442
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,200
-They gave me the role. -Obviously.

443
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,200
We start rehearsals next week.

444
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,000
Listen. Is it true that there are people

445
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,360
who give dogs away because they can't take care of them?

446
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,480
Yes. There are many ads on the Internet.

447
00:27:59,320 --> 00:28:00,960
You can't stand dogs.

448
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:06,560
He would never do it do not abandon him

449
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:31,320
Bruno?

450
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,120
Bruno, I'm leaving.

451
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:39,200
-So early? -I have things to do. Bye.

452
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,000
Dad.

453
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,120
No teacher tells his life story in class.

454
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,920
Don't make friends with the students. It's pathetic.

455
00:28:53,280 --> 00:28:55,880
Look, Bruno, I teach like that.

456
00:28:56,800 --> 00:29:00,840
And I didn't see your peers bothered. Yes? Bye.

457
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:02,160
Just a moment.

458
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:09,480
If you want, tell them you are my father.

459
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,240
But don't say I do dance.

460
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,760
Damn it! Fuck 'em if they don't like it.

461
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,880
-Dad. -Yeah, okay, I won't say anything.

462
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:51,000
It's very good. I loved your personal opinion on the novel.

463
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,600
-Oh yeah? -Yeah. I already told you.

464
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,800
You have a great critical capacity, Joan.

465
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,320
-Thank you. -You have it.

466
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,960
-Well, I'm going to class. -Yes.

467
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,760
-I'm a little late. -What have you got there?

468
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,880
Last night a friend called me.

469
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,400
He told me that they were going to put a few dogs to sleep.

470
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,560
-We're... -Yes.

471
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,940
Yes. It happens often. Me,

472
00:30:08,940 --> 00:30:10,960
too. I have friends who work in kennels.

473
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:15,720
They gave me one. I could not resist. It's beautiful, look.

474
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,440
He's cute!

475
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,720
-And they were going to kill him?

476
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:22,160
Why? -Yes, you see. I don't know.

477
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,360
He's very quiet. I spoke with the concierge

478
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,520
-and he'll take care of him for me. -That's good.

479
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,170
You have to take him to the vet.

480
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:30,480
I know a very good one. Do you want his number?

481
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:34,400
Perfect. Actually, it was madness, because I cannot do that now.

482
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:36,640
Do you think he would receive me as an emergency?

483
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,240
Do you want me to go?

484
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,480
I know him well. I have an hour off in the morning.

485
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,220
-Perfect. Thank you, thank you.

486
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:45,320
-Come on. Everyone to class, it's late.

487
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,680
Do not turn on all the lights of the departments.

488
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,080
Let's save. Let us take advantage of daylight.

489
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:51,830
I'll leave it at my friend's

490
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,800
clinic and he'll call me when he has seen him.

491
00:30:53,920 --> 00:30:56,440
-As you like. -Don't worry. You can trust me.

492
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:02,760
-What a beautiful thing. -Yeah. The dog, too.

493
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,360
Silence! Everyone to their seats.

494
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,200
Let's see, is someone missing in class?

497
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,800
He's a bit weird. He has not come for two months.

498
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,240
The freak?

499
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:03,520
All right.

500
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,280
This is my last name.

501
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:23,160
It was true! He's Bruno's father! That's crazy!

502
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:24,920
Bruno, if you're annoyed,

503
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:27,280
you'll stay home Saturday and won't go out.

504
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:33,280
Let's see. I don't feel like staying in class today. Follow me.

505
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,480
Do you think this is a joke? Follow me!

506
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:43,360
-Where? -Come on! Come, follow me!

507
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:48,920
Come on!

508
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:02,160
And so we get to one of the most important theater authors

509
00:33:02,440 --> 00:33:06,360
of Catalan Literature of the twentieth century.

510
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,400
Does anyone know his name?

511
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,600
No one knows his name?

512
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:15,920
A playwright.

513
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,120
No one knows his name?

514
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:37,080
Good morning.

515
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,610
Good. I brought you here

516
00:33:50,610 --> 00:33:54,320
because I find this to be an inspiring place.

517
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:58,760
The brain could be the kitchen of the human being.

518
00:33:59,520 --> 00:34:00,780
And also to explain to you that,

519
00:34:00,780 --> 00:34:02,080
more than two thousand years ago,

520
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,540
there were students of

521
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:06,240
Philosophy who were called the peripatetic.

522
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,280
-Pathetic. -What?

523
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:09,710
No, no. Peripatetic.

524
00:34:09,710 --> 00:34:12,280
They were students of the Aristotelian school.

525
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,280
We will talk about Aristotle. They got that name

526
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,240
because they philosophized while walking.

527
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:23,880
Walk. Walk, walk. Walk!

528
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,800
Come on, walk, follow me. Come.

529
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:32,000
The peripatetic wandered while reflecting.

530
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:34,240
I don't know if you'll understand.

531
00:34:35,480 --> 00:34:37,760
Come on. Ponder as you walk.

532
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:40,360
If you have an interesting thought, share it.

533
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,920
-I'm pissing! -I said an interesting thought.

534
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,280
Show your dick.

535
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,720
-You'd hallucinate with my dick. -Yes, sure.

537
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,640
Your father is getting weird.

538
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:04,320
-Shut up, girl! -What's up? I didn't say anything.

539
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,120
I was silent for two reasons. To think about the answer

540
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,880
and to show you that, when one thinks, people look at him badly.

541
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:29,220
Why is thinking frowned upon?

542
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:31,000
Shouldn't it be the other way around?

543
00:35:31,080 --> 00:35:32,400
Isn't it more objectionable

544
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
when people don't reflect about things?

545
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,080
In Philosophy class, you can prove that you're rational animals.

546
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:48,720
In the other classes, you can remain just animals and that's it.

547
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:52,600
Come on, walk, gang of bipeds! Go! Walk!

548
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:57,360
If children went to class as penguins or dolphins,

549
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,680
now this class will be the class of the peripatetic.

551
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:06,000
Yes. You didn't answer me. Can everyone philosophize?

552
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,320
-What do you think? -Me?

553
00:36:09,320 --> 00:36:15,120
I believe that if philosophy serves to question what we know,

554
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,500
everyone can do it, but it doesn't matter.

555
00:36:17,500 --> 00:36:19,040
Not everyone wants to do it.

556
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:23,080
You've just become my favorite student.

557
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:25,400
-Come on! -Wow, man!

558
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,920
That doesn't mean the others cannot struggle for the post.

559
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:32,600
-I'm coming at you, my friend. -Easy, guys.

560
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,760
It was just my luck not to have listened to your Catalan teacher.

561
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:38,360
He told me to be careful because you are disrespectful.

562
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:45,960
Come on, walk! Think! Walk and think!

563
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:49,720
-Fucking Eugeni Bosch... -Think!

564
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:57,180
All right. Send it to me

565
00:36:57,190 --> 00:36:59,200
by mail and I'll tell you something, okay?

566
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,280
-Hello. -What's up?

567
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:03,280
Eugeni Bosch criticizes me with the teachers.

568
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:05,280
Come on. That is not true. Surely...

569
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:07,680
-And they say he's not on to us. -Eugeni is not on to you.

570
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,200
He said to watch out for me and insulted me.

572
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,680
Go.

573
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,400
What? How did it go in the kitchen with the kids?

574
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:35,720
-All right. -It was all we needed.

575
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:39,560
All schools have the typical teacher who teaches creatively.

576
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,280
-May God spare me from being orthodox. -Yeah.

577
00:37:44,120 --> 00:37:49,160
I'm more classical, I admit. I don't make friends with the kids.

578
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:51,780
I think it very important

579
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:55,280
to keep distance between teacher and student.

580
00:37:55,600 --> 00:37:58,760
I'm more interested in the distance between teacher and teacher.

581
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:03,440
Yeah. Bruno can't find having you in class too enjoyable.

582
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,360
He's delighted.

584
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:11,560
I volunteered.

586
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,680
He has agoraphobia. He doesn't want to leave the house.

587
00:38:16,760 --> 00:38:19,200
He seemed a bit weird to us, but he's a good student.

588
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:21,560
I'll do everything possible to take him to the street.

589
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:24,840
Yeah. When he sees you entering his house, he'll get out.

590
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:35,680
-What's wrong with him? -Nothing, nothing.

591
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,440
Laia likes puppies a lot, right?

592
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,360
A lot.

593
00:38:42,280 --> 00:38:43,840
A lot.

594
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,440
Is it so difficult to teach a normal class?

595
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,800
The concept of "Normal" Would lead us to an endless debate.

596
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:52,800
-For you, what is normal? -Normal is normal, Dad. Normal.

597
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:55,080
Damn. What a deep son I have.

598
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,360
Look, what is considered normal today wasn't normal years ago.

599
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:01,560
-It's a Foucauldian lesson. -Why do you always say weird things?

600
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,840
"Fucciana". What the hell does that mean?

601
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:06,080
Why do you act like that with my friends?

602
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:08,000
You were silent for three minutes.

603
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,800
And then that idiocy of thinking.

604
00:39:10,280 --> 00:39:13,120
-You're jealous of Pol. -Oh, yes. I'm dying of jealousy.

605
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:16,400
Pol is very upset with Eugeni because of what you told him.

606
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,280
It doesn't surprise me.

607
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,440
Why did you tell him?

608
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:23,800
Listen, Bruno. Eugeni is the kind of teacher that I detest.

609
00:39:23,880 --> 00:39:25,840
He believes students are his enemies.

610
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:27,760
When he enters the class, he looks for the evil.

611
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:29,270
-For me, they go unnoticed.

612
00:39:29,270 --> 00:39:31,400
-Bruno, I'll wait for you outside, okay?

613
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:33,040
-Well, I'm going. -Fine.

614
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:35,520
I just ask you not to emphasize things.

615
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,840
You'll have to get used to having me as your teacher.

616
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:39,400
Bruno, my champion!

617
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,650
See? You will make more friends

618
00:39:40,650 --> 00:39:42,360
being the son of the professor of Philosophy.

619
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:45,440
Dad,

620
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,660
I don't understand the peripatetic thing.

621
00:39:48,670 --> 00:39:50,560
Can you explain it to me at home?

622
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,880
Wikipedia, son. Wikipedia.

623
00:39:58,600 --> 00:40:01,440
-Can we talk for a minute? -Yes, of course. Sit down.

624
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:04,680
Listen.

625
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:10,040
Toni, how did you let Eugeni get in the home of an agoraphobic?

626
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:13,200
It's cruel, it's like Dickens.

627
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:18,820
See? You come in here and

628
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:22,160
you talk to me as if we were great friends.

630
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:25,770
You've been here for two

631
00:40:25,770 --> 00:40:27,440
days and you are already creating problems.

632
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,440
Did you tell Pol Rubio that Eugeni criticizes him?

633
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:32,360
It's true. He criticizes him.

634
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,680
Students should not be privy to teachers' conversations.

635
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:39,120
Look, Toni. I can't stand that kind of mediocre teacher.

636
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:41,400
-I've met many, and they drive me crazy.

637
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,120
-Eugeni is a very good teacher.

638
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,440
No. He knows how to sell himself. He has no talent.

639
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:49,560
-Come on. Let's leave it here. -Let's leave it here.

641
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,640
It seems the kid felt detached from the group.

642
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,960
Occasionally, he wouldn't come to class, or was late.

643
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,040
Finally, he stopped coming.

644
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,400
His mother brought us the medical report.

645
00:41:05,720 --> 00:41:07,880
He was diagnosed with early agoraphobia.

646
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,320
And he does not leave the house?

647
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:10,380
No, he doesn't want to

648
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,320
and he doesn't want a psychologist, either.

649
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:15,280
She is a single mother, works all day and...

650
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,560
In short, she can't take over.

651
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:20,400
I promised I would find a volunteer teacher

652
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,280
to follow up with the kid. Eugeni volunteered.

653
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,920
That will mean an aggravation of the illness.

655
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:35,640
He starts tomorrow. No costs, obviously.

656
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,400
How generous.

657
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,680
Yes?

658
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:42,640
Yes, I'll look at it now. Give me second.

659
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:58,600
Very well. Thank you very much.

660
00:41:59,960 --> 00:42:01,080
Bye!

662
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:06,770
-Fine! Wow, what a relief.

663
00:42:06,770 --> 00:42:08,840
-You can pick him up whenever you want.

664
00:42:09,120 --> 00:42:12,000
Yeah, but I had to leave my apartment,

665
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:14,400
and now I'm temporarily at my mother's house.

666
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,320
And I haven't talked to her.

667
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,000
What will you do if she doesn't want it there?

668
00:42:18,080 --> 00:42:19,120
I don't know.

669
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,290
Argue, I guess, because I'm

670
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:22,040
not going to abandon the dog in the street.

671
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:25,480
I was thinking...

672
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,440
and, if you can't care for him, I wouldn't mind keeping him.

673
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:30,840
But you already have one, right?

674
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,760
Yes, but I fell in love with that puppy

675
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,840
and I wouldn't mind having two.

676
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:39,880
-You'll have to ask your partner. -Why? I live alone.

677
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,600
-Oh yeah? -Yes.

678
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,810
It's perfect if he could stay with you.

679
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:45,400
In fact, you'd do me a favor.

680
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:48,360
-I got myself in a bind. -I'd be enchanted.

681
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:51,520
What if the two dogs don't get along?

682
00:42:51,600 --> 00:42:54,400
-I guess they will. -Listen, why...?

683
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:57,720
Let's walk them in a park to check?

684
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:00,280
Good.

685
00:43:00,360 --> 00:43:03,040
-Well, see you later? -Yes, perfect.

686
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,760
-All right. Bye. -Bye.

688
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,280
I must go back to the bar.

689
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,640
Do not force me to call the police. Please!

690
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:21,440
Out of order

695
00:43:45,320 --> 00:43:46,360
Yes.

696
00:43:46,840 --> 00:43:50,320
I'm from the Angel Guimera Institute. I'm the tutor.

697
00:43:51,120 --> 00:43:53,840
We were expecting you tomorrow. My name is Miriam.

699
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:58,080
Was it not Eugeni?

700
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,380
-No, there must be some confusion.

701
00:44:00,390 --> 00:44:02,120
-It doesn't matter. It's good you came.

703
00:44:04,520 --> 00:44:05,720
I'll talk to him.

705
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,240
I must go back to the bar.

706
00:44:14,080 --> 00:44:17,080
I manage the bar in front. I left a moment and I have to go back.

707
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:19,400
-Relax. I'll take care of this. -Thank you.

708
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:24,160
Toni told me not to pay, but I insist. Let's negotiate a price.

709
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,160
We'll talk about that later. Relax.

711
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,000
Thank you. If you need anything, I'm at the bar.

712
00:44:33,080 --> 00:44:34,880
Yes, go. Don't worry.

714
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,840
From now on, I am your private teacher,

715
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:49,680
while you don't go back to school. Can you open for me?

716
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:58,640
Ah! I'm sitting on the couch of a teacher.

717
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,600
-Your mother is a teacher, too. -So what?

718
00:45:02,960 --> 00:45:04,960
At least your mother doesn't work in the school.

719
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:08,720
I like your father. When I'm a teacher, I want to be like him.

720
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:12,080
-Hello! -Hello, grandma.

721
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:16,000
-Oh! Who is this pretty girl? -Tania.

722
00:45:16,560 --> 00:45:18,880
Very good. I am Carmina Calduch.

723
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,480
Yes, I know. You are an actress. The one in the ad, right?

724
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,960
Baby, believe me, I made better things than that dip ad.

725
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:28,330
Of course, of course.

726
00:45:28,330 --> 00:45:29,920
You're one of the best actresses in the country.

727
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:33,080
Oh yeah? And who are the others?

728
00:45:36,440 --> 00:45:39,360
These people from the theater are a bit... nuts.

729
00:45:40,760 --> 00:45:42,360
You can tell she gave birth to my weirdo father.

730
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,320
What's wrong?

732
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,320
-Yes. -Yeah. Liar!

733
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,680
Tell me. You're hiding something from me.

734
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:55,480
Let's see.

735
00:45:56,600 --> 00:45:58,640
It seems... Well, it doesn't seem.

736
00:46:00,680 --> 00:46:01,920
I like someone.

737
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,040
Bastard! You didn't tell me!

738
00:46:08,120 --> 00:46:10,280
Don't good friends tell each other everything?

739
00:46:11,240 --> 00:46:13,480
-Who? -I'm not going to tell you.

740
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,320
-Why? -Because you won't dance with me.

741
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:18,560
I can dance anytime. Tell me who you like!

742
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:20,360
-I'm not going to tell you. -Who? Tell me!

743
00:46:20,440 --> 00:46:21,440
-No! -Tell me!

744
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:25,640
Girl, girl, that pillow is a souvenir from Cyrano.

745
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:26,880
Oh, sorry!

746
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:30,760
-I told you I like Marc. -Marc is a pig.

747
00:46:30,840 --> 00:46:33,120
When I have a boyfriend, maybe I'm a little sow.

748
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:45,120
In fact, your volunteer teacher will come tomorrow, Eugeni Bosch.

749
00:46:45,320 --> 00:46:46,680
I went ahead.

750
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:52,120
You must be like those cynical philosophers who believed

751
00:46:52,200 --> 00:46:56,440
they could only achieve virtue out of society, right?

752
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:59,200
The thing is I am a teacher of Philosophy, you know?

753
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:08,440
I'll tell you an anecdote.

754
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:12,200
When Diogenes was a slave,

755
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:15,240
his owner asked, "What do you do best?"

756
00:47:15,640 --> 00:47:17,400
Do you know what he said?

757
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:22,640
He said, "I know how to command. I order you to release me."

758
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,400
So, the owner granted him his freedom...

759
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:29,960
and made him his children's tutor.

760
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:33,200
Did you like it?

761
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,920
I guess you don't give a fuck,

762
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:39,600
but Eugeni won't tell you these anecdotes.

763
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:47,560
Very good. Goodbye. Stay there.

764
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:06,560
Work is piling up.

765
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,640
-Gorgeous. -It's obvious they got along.

766
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:17,480
Yes. Everyone was watching them in the park.

767
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:22,560
Pispa, Pispa, are you having fun with...?

768
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:25,640
What name are you going to call him?

769
00:48:26,520 --> 00:48:29,680
-Descartes. -Descartes? The philosopher?

770
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,200
Oui, Descartes.

771
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:33,600
I like French sounds very much.

772
00:48:33,720 --> 00:48:34,720
-Yes? -Yes.

773
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:36,720
-I lived in Paris. -In Paris?

774
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:40,240
-When my mother worked there. -Let's hear it. Speak French.

775
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:43,240
What do you want me to say? What am I supposed to talk about?

776
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:47,240
Philosophy. Descartes, for example.

777
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,200
Bonne. Je suis une chose qui pense.

778
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:54,280
I'm a thinking thing.

779
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,280
Qui doute, qui affirme, qui nie.

780
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:00,800
Who doubts,

781
00:49:01,720 --> 00:49:02,800
who states...

782
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:05,160
Qui nie?

783
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:10,440
Who denies. Qui aime.

784
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,320
Wait. I'm going to feed the dogs.

785
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,880
Qui aime, qui veut, qui ne veut pas.

786
00:49:19,720 --> 00:49:24,800
-Je pense, donque je suis. -I think, therefore I am.

787
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:12,080
That's messed up! You didn't tell me.

788
00:50:12,160 --> 00:50:14,400
Hahaha.

789
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:18,960
Are you going to tell me who you like?

790
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,440
Yes, some day.

791
00:50:24,520 --> 00:50:25,640
So? How are you?

792
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:28,440
What? Are we going to talk about something deep?

793
00:50:29,840 --> 00:50:31,140
At the end of the day,

794
00:50:31,140 --> 00:50:33,760
you have your father's sense of humor. Fine.

795
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:38,040
-Are you happy? -Yes. Got a little extra today.

796
00:50:38,920 --> 00:50:39,920
What for?

798
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:43,680
He didn't talk much.

799
00:50:43,760 --> 00:50:46,680
No, no. But he opened the door for me. It's a start.

800
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:48,560
Here.

801
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:55,840
A new mobile.

802
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,600
It's Chinese, a knockoff of the real one.

803
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,960
No, no, no, sorry. Good phones copy that.

804
00:51:04,040 --> 00:51:05,880
It's better than the one you had, yes or no?

805
00:51:07,200 --> 00:51:10,560
-Yes. -Good. You're welcome.

806
00:51:10,960 --> 00:51:12,680
Thank you.

807
00:51:14,120 --> 00:51:17,040
The peripatetic were students of Philosophy...

808
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,180
I know. I looked it up on Wikipedia.

810
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:24,640
Good night.

811
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,800
Dad.

812
00:51:30,520 --> 00:51:34,040
I'm scared of what you can do in class.

813
00:51:40,040 --> 00:51:42,520
Admit that you are weird...

814
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,080
complicated.

815
00:51:45,640 --> 00:51:50,040
Yes, yes, yes. Yes, I'm complicated. Yes, yes.

816
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:54,280
But I'm still much better than the world you live in, son.

817
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,840
Everything is crap.

818
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:59,160
But I don't want you to fall into laziness nor pessimism.

819
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:01,480
I want you to get involved in things,

820
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:03,720
to be critical of what is around you.

821
00:52:03,920 --> 00:52:06,600
Yes. I know it's horrible to think about these issues,

822
00:52:06,680 --> 00:52:08,480
but I don't think teenagers

823
00:52:08,490 --> 00:52:11,640
have only sex and getting drunk in their heads.

824
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,760
They also have fears, right?

825
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:20,280
They want to experience new things, but they are scared.

826
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:24,600
They are like amateur actors

827
00:52:24,680 --> 00:52:27,400
before going on stage for the first time.

828
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:31,560
Oh, I don't know. Look...

829
00:52:32,440 --> 00:52:36,000
you may fall in love someday and not be loved back.

830
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,060
Such is life. Not always

831
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:40,000
the one who likes you is the one you like.

832
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,840
Yes, Bruno. You have a complicated father or whatever...

833
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:47,640
But I'm the best teacher you'll ever had.

834
00:52:48,320 --> 00:52:50,400
And, in time, you will see that I am right.

835
00:52:52,600 --> 00:52:55,520
Patience. I know I'm difficult,

836
00:52:55,600 --> 00:52:58,400
but you will have to take it with philosophy.

838
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:07,800
Not the school at your service.

839
00:53:08,440 --> 00:53:10,840
Please, do not ignore rules anymore.

840
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,560
Who wants to cheat in the literary contest?

841
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,760
What is this guy saying? He's crazy!

842
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,440
-What's up? -I missed a period.

843
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:23,240
What?

844
00:53:23,840 --> 00:53:26,800
It was sex and that's it. But you liked it, didn't you?

845
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:30,160
You know what I'm saying? Between us, it won't happen again.

846
00:53:30,320 --> 00:53:31,960
I wrote some verses for the poem.

847
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:33,960
Will you read them to your father?

848
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:36,400
Very good.

849
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,040
You revved up the chicken coop!

850
00:53:38,120 --> 00:53:40,320
Everything was very quiet until you arrived!

851
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:45,680
-Oh my God! -But didn't you say he wouldn't be here?

852
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:47,080
Give to me!

853
00:53:48,080 --> 00:53:49,240
-Son... -Son, no!

854
00:53:49,320 --> 00:53:51,160
And get dressed, heck! What are you doing with your balls?

855
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:52,040
Yes!

857
00:53:58,880 --> 00:54:01,440
-Shut the fuck up. Back off. -Marc, leave it.

858
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:02,800
I know what's wrong.

859
00:54:04,520 --> 00:54:06,080
What are you doing, you son of a bitch?

860
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:08,000
-Pol, hell! Enough! -Great!
