1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,240
Merlí, I know I should not say anything.

2
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,040
-And I know it's none of my business. -There comes a "But."

3
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:20,000
But be discreet. I don't want any problems.

4
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,520
What are you afraid of, Toni? That we fuck in the faculty room?

5
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:24,720
Dammit, Merlí.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,640
Excuse me. Merlí, someone to see you. The mother of a freshman.

7
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,680
Probably the mother of the new student, Mónica.

8
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:32,960
No, it's Gerard Piguillem's mother.

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,320
If she belongs to PTA, I won't go. PTA parents drive me nuts.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:38,440
She might want to propose

11
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,200
some sort of activity on Saturday morning.

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:41,280
Merlí, please!

13
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,180
I'm kidding, dammit. I'm kidding.

14
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:45,120
Toni, you need some sense of humor.

15
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,160
-Merlí. -I have a visitor.

16
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,640
Just a moment, please.

17
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:02,200
It's just that I'm really upset. Everybody knows.

18
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:05,080
-It's normal. -Albert doesn't talk to me.

19
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:06,440
After what happened, you

20
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:09,240
wouldn't expect him to invite to eat out, would you?

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,560
I know, but I'm upset with this. What do you think?

22
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,080
Okay. Yes, I understand.

23
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,360
I don't know, do as you wish.

24
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,080
I think we could go on seeing each other.

25
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,760
Ah, you do?

26
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,400
Look, no. We'd rather not, Merlí.

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:34,080
Hi.

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,040
-Are you Merlí? -Yeah.

29
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:40,240
-The janitor. -Yes. I'm Gina. Gerard's mother.

30
00:01:43,480 --> 00:01:45,120
I didn't imagine you like that.

31
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,480
I don't have much time.

32
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:24,000
Gerard knows I want to talk to you, but he doesn't know I'm here.

33
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:26,050
He freaks out when I come to school.

34
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:28,240
He says I only complain of the teachers.

35
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,360
Ah! These are Gerard's.

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,530
They fell down from the clothesline.

37
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:32,720
The neighbor leaves them on the stairs.

38
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,660
The kid doesn't use

39
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:35,760
clothespins because he says they leave a mark.

40
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:38,160
As if someone would see his underwear.

41
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,320
I'm looking forward to the end of this teenage phase. Soon!

42
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,040
I'm sorry. Have you come to complain about my classes?

43
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,760
No, I came to congratulate you. I'm sorry.

44
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,560
Hello. I hear you.

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:51,320
No, I don't intend to give in.

46
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:55,400
Talk to his lawyer and lie so you can get what I want.

47
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,960
Okay, we can talk later.

48
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,880
I'm sorry.

49
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,840
Well, yes, you're a brilliant teacher.

50
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:06,120
I thought fucking great that thing of the erotic poem.

51
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,400
-You don't mind I talk like that, do you? -No, no.

52
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:12,280
Lately, at home, things are just crap.

53
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,880
Too many mistakes, a bad environment.

54
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,440
Like puzzle pieces that don't fit. Gosh! What a shabby metaphor.

55
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,280
Gerard was pretty bad and your classes gave him a push,

56
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,000
-even though it's just Philosophy. -Sorry?

57
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:30,280
I mean, they're not as important as other subjects.

58
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,200
It's not Math or Literature.

59
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,760
It's more important than Math and Literature.

60
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:37,120
Yes! And it's fundamental to play the flute in Music.

61
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,920
I'm sorry. Are you upset?

62
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,440
-No. -I meant no harm.

63
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:45,000
Philosophy is important, I wouldn't say it's not.

64
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,440
Life, death, God.

65
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,000
"Man is the measure of all things." Heraclitus.

66
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,600
Protagoras.

67
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:54,920
True, true. One of the small ones. Yes, yes.

68
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,280
-Small ones? -Yes, the small ones.

69
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:59,920
-Those who came before Socrates. -Pre-Socratic.

70
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,160
Yes, yes.

71
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:03,760
The thing is that Protagoras was not one of the small ones.

72
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,880
He was a sophist. But anyway. Aren't you in a hurry?

73
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,320
-I pissed you off. -No, lady.

74
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,040
Remember, I came to congratulate you.

75
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,980
Gerard is delighted with your classes,

76
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,360
and I love seeing him happy.

77
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,080
And I thank you for that. I hope you go on like that.

78
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,200
I can't do it any other way.

79
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,280
I'm going to be late for work. Goodbye, Merlí.

80
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:26,560
Goodbye.

81
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,480
How did rich and powerful people get to be where they are?

82
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,840
Are they smarter? More beautiful? No. Nothing like that.

83
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,760
Machiavelli would simply say they are more evil.

84
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,240
If you want to be successful in life, trample on the others.

85
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,760
You will succeed in a dishonorable way,

86
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,800
but that's not a problem, as long as you get where you want.

87
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,440
That is, it doesn't matter who's ruling, but how they are ruling.

88
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,960
Exactly. Very well.

89
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,600
What do you think, Gerard? The ends justify the means?

90
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,080
Well, I think that...

91
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:10,160
I think that... it depends on the ends. Right?

92
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,080
Berta, do the ends justify the means?

93
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,040
What do I know? Do you think I ask myself this kind of stuff?

94
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,720
You're right. I'm the one who asks. Yes, speak up, Joan.

95
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:26,480
I was checking the subject's syllabus and that's not covered.

96
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,400
While we've missed other subjects.

97
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,800
Joan, my friend. Dammit. It's always the same story.

98
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,240
We have a teacher who's quite good and fun,

99
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,720
who does what he feels like.

100
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:37,900
We'll see the whole syllabus,

101
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,680
don't worry. But we'll see it my way.

102
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:43,040
I like mentioning other thinkers, though they're not included.

103
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,260
So, you can take your syllabus and,

104
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:47,280
since there's no paper in the toilets,

105
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,400
you can use it to wipe your ass.

106
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,800
Look, look. Look.

107
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,280
-Hi. Everything all right? -Yes, everything all right.

108
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:01,760
Come in. Good morning.

109
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,640
Well, I bring a new student.

110
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,070
Her name is Mónica de Villamore.

111
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:09,560
Did I say it right? Yes? Very well.

112
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:12,280
She's starting today. Come on. Good luck.

113
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,400
Hello, Mónica. You can take a seat.

114
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,800
Well.

115
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,200
-Wipe the drool! -Very well.

116
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:25,600
-I think I'm falling in love. -In The Prince,

117
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,460
Machiavelli considers

118
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:30,520
that the power of the state is above it all.

119
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,640
To the point that, in an extreme situation,

120
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:36,960
the ruler can resort to cruelty and deceit in a legit way.

121
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:41,280
What do you think? Mónica.

122
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,970
I don't know. It's tough

123
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:49,680
that a state can overrule law to defend itself.

124
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,400
Besides, why should it

125
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,880
dispose of our lives without any limitation?

126
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,200
That's an excellent reflection.

127
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,560
Man, I've fallen in love!

128
00:07:08,920 --> 00:07:11,000
Come on! An office for Merlí!

129
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,560
I'm starting to think he's the principal's darling.

130
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:15,760
No way. He's offered himself to help out the students

131
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,140
who have difficulty in Philosophy.

132
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,320
It's just for four hours a week.

133
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,720
I've been teaching here for a long time

134
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,720
and I never had not even one hour of a private office.

135
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:27,200
What are you saying?

136
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,720
You're the head teacher. We share an office.

137
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:29,640
What are you complaining of?

138
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:32,200
Merlí has a privilege that I don't have.

139
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:35,800
When students have doubts, we sort it out after class,

140
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:37,100
or they should come to the

141
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:39,280
department's office, as it's always been done.

142
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,640
After what he did in the literary contest, now this?

143
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:44,470
And you didn't mention the

144
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:46,600
mess he's created between Albert and Laia.

145
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,320
What happened?

146
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,160
Laia and Merlí are hooking up. He stole Albert's girlfriend.

147
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:56,080
-My God. -That's private matter.

148
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:59,000
Toni, I understand that Merlí might be talented,

149
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,440
but to give him an office?

150
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,720
Talented? Talented? What talent are we talking about?

151
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,920
Somebody explain it to me, please.

152
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Is it talent to take the students on a stroll around school?

153
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,920
One shows talent in class.

154
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,080
I don't dislike him, but it seems you forgive him everything.

155
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,960
No, no. I've been quite blunt with him since his arrival.

156
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,240
But I can't scold a teacher who wants to help the students.

157
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,800
You should prepare yourselves to help students who need!

158
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:26,260
-In the same room Merlí is using.

159
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,560
-Toni, I don't get paid for that.

160
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,920
It doesn't seem a bad idea.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,910
But in the end of the day I

162
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,440
devote more time to students than to my kids.

163
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:36,480
Mireia, it's not a bad idea.

164
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:41,920
Okay.

165
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,520
We'll do it.

166
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:49,080
-Great. -We'll do it.

167
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,520
How are the classes with Iván?

168
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,960
Well, well, we've been reviewing a little bit of everything.

169
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:57,720
He hasn't spoken for weeks. Does he talk to you?

170
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:01,600
He only makes gestures or writes. It's something.

171
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,080
The same with me,

172
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,050
and I keep saying he should

173
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:05,480
see a psychologist. But he doesn't want to.

174
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:07,680
It wouldn't be of any help. One can't force him to.

175
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,420
I work all day long in a bar.

176
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,760
It's not that Iván doesn't leave home.

177
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,240
But he's obsessed with the Internet.

178
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,560
He spends all day long reading newspapers, or blogs...

179
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,280
-He reads newspapers? -Yes. And I don't think that's bad,

180
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,320
but it's somewhat sick. He wants to know everything.

181
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,960
Before shutting himself in,

182
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,600
he used to do that. I have a strange kid.

183
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:27,760
Yes. And on top of that, he makes a mess of the house.

184
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,160
If the house disgusts you, you don't have to come.

185
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
No. I don't care about the house. I don't mind.

186
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,880
And I don't care about the lessons.

187
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,120
But I want him to be able to leave the house.

188
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:40,840
I know he's got early agoraphobia, but we are on time.

189
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:42,280
We'll see.

190
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,600
You've got to trust Iván. And he has to notice that.

191
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,560
I'll pay you for the classes you've taught so far.

192
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,350
No. I'd rather be paid

193
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:52,760
by the end of the month. It doesn't matter.

194
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,680
I'll come by the house

195
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,120
before going to the bar and clean it up a bit.

196
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,080
No. Don't do that. He's got to do it.

197
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,600
You won't succeed.

198
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,360
Leave it to me.

199
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,040
Don't clean anything. Okay?

200
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:13,800
You're the only one to help me.

201
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:19,800
You liked the new girl, right? Your father freaked out with her.

202
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:22,200
Don't worry. You'll still be his favorite.

203
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,480
Marc Vilaseca.

204
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,040
A c!

205
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,920
Joan, your grades have dropped too much, lately.

206
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,840
-What happened to you? -I don't know.

207
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,080
Come on. Make an effort, you can do better.

208
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:39,600
-A C plus? What's the problem with you? -Leave me alone.

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,680
Pol Rubio, Bruno Bergeron, thank you for participating.

210
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,200
A damned D?

211
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:49,360
A D. This guy is picking on me more and more.

212
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,160
I thought I'd get a better grade.

213
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,800
Any problem, little Bergeron?

214
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,280
Question two is perfect.

215
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,880
I wrote what's in the book. And you gave me half for it.

216
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,920
You have a D. There's nothing to discuss.

217
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,040
Fucking shit.

218
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:06,760
Have you learned this kind of impertinence at home?

219
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,840
You'd better study harder for the next test,

220
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:12,480
-which is in three days. -What?

221
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:13,560
How come? Three days?

222
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:15,560
-How come another test in three days?

223
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:17,080
-About the two latest themes.

224
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,360
Those whose work is up to date won't have any problems.

225
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,240
-Damned Hitler. -Fucking shit!

226
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,320
Pol and Bruno, do you want me to kick you out of classroom?

227
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,620
What's the problem of Hitler with you?

228
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:39,800
He has picked you as his target.

229
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:41,760
He picks on me because of my father!

230
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:44,760
Two teachers pick on me, fat Santi and Hitler.

231
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,240
No. Santi does not pick on you.

232
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,220
He doesn't? He makes me

233
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,000
fail whenever he feels like. And Eugeni, too.

234
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,800
He can't stand my father and makes me fail.

235
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:56,440
-He's jealous. Merlí is a better teacher. -Yeah. Much better.

236
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:59,440
If we fail the test, we'll fail the final evaluation, you know.

237
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:00,640
Too bad.

238
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,320
It's really bad for me, man.

239
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:04,560
It's hard for me to memorize stuff. I can't do it.

240
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:05,940
-I can't remember, Bruno!

241
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,200
I can't! -Why don't you come study with me?

242
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:11,320
Does it work for you to study with others?

243
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:15,280
-With Tania. We do. -Yeah. And between lessons...

244
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,280
We're friends.

245
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,840
Well, if you don't feel like, don't come.

246
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:22,240
No, no, no. To go to your place is a really interesting idea.

247
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,760
-Is it? -I have never been at a teacher's home.

248
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,400
See you later. A D in Catalan.

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,600
-Damn! Congrats! -Eugeni is picking on me.

250
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:39,880
There you go with this picking on you. Don't give me that speech.

251
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:41,480
He picks on me because I'm your son.

252
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,800
He's giving another test in three days, and I'll fail it.

253
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,880
Dammit! I didn't use to fail before. Talk to him. Do something.

254
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,800
Talk to him? But who do you think you are?

255
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:51,640
You are the one who should do two things.

256
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:55,280
To study for the next test and to accept that Eugeni is mediocre.

257
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
Pass it to me! Pass it to me.

258
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
I think Eugeni never fucks, man.

259
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,080
I mean it. If he fucked, we all would pass.

260
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:12,640
What do you think, Gery?

261
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:14,760
-The test. -What test?

262
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:18,160
-He's head over heels for this girl. -Her name is Mónica, okay?

263
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,480
Weren't you in love with Judith, of the senior year?

264
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,760
-Yeah. Like you were getting married. -No, dammit! Okay?

265
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,720
I want to be with Mónica de Villamore. It's crystal clear.

266
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,960
Well, there she is. She's got nice tits.

267
00:13:30,280 --> 00:13:31,600
-I tell you. -Go talk to her!

268
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,320
Are you insane, man? What would I say?

269
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:38,760
Look.

270
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:43,760
-Go there and introduce yourself. -Sure. No fear, man. Go for it.

271
00:13:43,840 --> 00:13:46,360
Shut up, Joan. You've never introduced yourself to a girl.

272
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:50,360
Man, it's your chance. If you don't go now... Come on.

273
00:13:50,440 --> 00:13:51,440
Come on, go.

274
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:53,000
-Come on, come on, go, go. -Okay, okay.

275
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
Look, look.

276
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,920
"Hello, gorgeous. How are you?

277
00:13:57,240 --> 00:13:58,660
Would you like to come to my place?

278
00:13:58,660 --> 00:14:00,080
I've got something to show to you."

279
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:05,480
Hello.

280
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,440
Do you want the class schedule or...?

281
00:14:09,640 --> 00:14:11,440
No, no, thank you. I already have it.

282
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,360
Aren't you hot with that... with that sweatshirt? No...?

283
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,120
No, I'm good.

284
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:48,520
-Very bad. Very bad. -No, man. Champ!

285
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:49,640
How did it go?

286
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,880
She said we'll talk later.

287
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,200
-Pol, help him, you know. -Me? Lately, I haven't done so well.

288
00:14:57,280 --> 00:14:58,960
Go and ask for Merlí's advice, right?

289
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:01,400
Dammit, Joan, you don't talk much, but when you talk...

290
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,800
-Sure. Talk to Merlí! -Pol, can you read between the lines?

291
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,680
Tell me, how am I going to talk to a teacher about girls?

292
00:15:14,680 --> 00:15:15,800
I don't intend to.

293
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,720
-Hello. -Hello, Gerard. Come in.

294
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,440
-Look. Do you like it? -Yes, yes.

295
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:34,120
-Or do you prefer it like this? -Man! Love it!

296
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,080
Why are you here?

297
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:41,880
I have some doubts about things we spoke today.

298
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,840
What... What was it? The question asked...

299
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,360
What's her name? Mónica. The new student, you know?

300
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,920
Yes, Mónica. That was a good question.

301
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:53,800
Yes. She seems very smart and mature.

302
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:57,200
Yes. And you fell in love with her.

303
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:00,960
What...? No, no, no. I didn't fall in love. No.

304
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,240
Come on, man.

305
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,480
Well, yes, she's adorable. But she doesn't care for me.

306
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:08,280
What can I do? I mean, I never had a real girlfriend.

307
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:11,480
Well, let's see. I did things, but... but I don't know...

308
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:15,480
You told us that if we had doubts we could come, so...

309
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:19,280
Yes. Doubts about Philosophy. Not about stuffing the old turkey.

310
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:21,320
-I don't talk about sex. -No, no.

311
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,920
No, really. I fell in love eight times and this is for real.

312
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,200
So naive.

313
00:16:27,280 --> 00:16:30,280
Don't you have, I don't know, some kind of technique? Something?

314
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:31,800
-Technique? -Yes.

315
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,840
Seek advice from your parents.

316
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:35,440
Don't you get along with your father?

317
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:38,440
-I don't have a father. They split. -Obviously you have a father.

318
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:41,240
For me, he doesn't exist.

319
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:43,960
He cheated on my mother for two years.

320
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,480
He lied to us. My mother went through a hard time.

321
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,440
Easy, she'll get over it. I'm divorced, too.

322
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,680
Give my encouragement to your mother.

323
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,800
Okay.

324
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:02,160
Okay, I'm terrible.

325
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,960
You dared seek the advice of a teacher on how to flirt.

326
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,320
I'll help you with Mónica.

327
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,680
Perfect. Perfect. What do I do? Do I say something or...?

328
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
-No. Right now, you shut up. -Okay. Okay.

329
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,880
You've got to make Mónica show interest for you,

330
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,960
-the way I'm going to tell you. -Perfect. I'll listen to you.

331
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:24,360
-Shut up, dammit. -Okay.

332
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:33,000
You've got to learn this by heart.

333
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,640
Dammit!

334
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,480
-You're going to study at your place?

335
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,240
-Yes. And he's really interested.

336
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:45,320
-Bruno... -Tania...

337
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,400
-What? -He's not like you.

338
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:52,320
-That... You know. -We're friends, okay? That's it. Friends.

339
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,320
But you don't care for him just like a friend!

340
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,720
-You're upset because I didn't invite you.

341
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,480
-What are you saying? It's not that.

342
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:02,200
I just want you to be careful.

343
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,640
Be careful with Berta.

344
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,320
Okay. I see you want to live as a Malibu surfer,

345
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,560
but in piggy style.

346
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,360
Open potato bags,

347
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:49,800
sunflower seed shells, a bitten sandwich.

348
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,800
As Heraclitus would put it, everything is in motion.

349
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,400
This orange peel,

350
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:58,320
within a couple of months, will have an ecosystem.

351
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,520
Let's see this.

352
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:05,640
What about this Kleenex? Have you been watching porn?

353
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,640
It turns out that I like cleanliness.

354
00:19:12,680 --> 00:19:15,160
I hope you can accept my peculiarities.

355
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,470
Out there is the world of the living.

356
00:19:22,470 --> 00:19:24,560
Don't forget that you are part of it, too.

357
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,680
One day you'll have to come back.

358
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:34,440
Yes, kid. Yes. The world of the living.

359
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:36,800
How many lives do you think you have?

360
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,260
It is not a videogame where,

361
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:41,160
if you get killed, you still have more lives.

362
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,640
You have only one life here! Only one life!

363
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:08,120
Iván, I know you are listening to me.

364
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:11,160
Today, you won't be able to enjoy my class.

365
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,600
Besides,

366
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:14,400
if you look at your dining room,

367
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,120
you'll notice the computer is not there.

368
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,240
Son of a bitch!

369
00:20:18,560 --> 00:20:21,160
You have a wonderful voice, kid. That was about time.

370
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,880
I won't give you the computer back

371
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:26,080
before you clean the place and take a shower.

372
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:27,480
Dirty!

373
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:36,200
And Angel Guimerà, 1845... One thousand... fourteen?

374
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,880
Twenty-four.

375
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,720
Shit! I can't remember not even that.

376
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,440
Is your father coming or what?

377
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,080
I suppose.

378
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,110
Philosophy is cool with your father.

379
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:50,880
It must be nice to have such a father.

380
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:55,480
At home, I'm the weirdo, because I go to school, you know?

381
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:59,720
Well, I failed twice, but... But I go to school.

382
00:21:00,280 --> 00:21:01,600
What does your father do?

383
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,240
He doesn't have a job.

384
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:06,480
Sometimes he gets a temporary job to do some kind of shit.

385
00:21:07,240 --> 00:21:09,720
Assembly line for a couple of bucks.

386
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:11,480
How old were you when your mother died?

387
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,280
Nine.

388
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,520
Dammit, too many questions, right?

389
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,120
My granny is fantastic.

390
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,720
She spends all day watching old Marx Brothers' pictures.

391
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:28,640
She's the best in my family. I adore her.

392
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,330
We live with her and, once you're in,

393
00:21:31,330 --> 00:21:33,400
it seems you're living in the fucking 40s.

394
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,240
We were evicted from our rented place,

395
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,400
like it happened to your father.

396
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:41,520
-Don't you have a brother? -Yes, yes. The idiot.

397
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,400
We call him Oscar, too.

398
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,040
The family is what you get. Friends, you choose.

399
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,720
Do you have many friends on Facebook?

400
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:57,200
About 500. But real friends, 70.

401
00:21:57,800 --> 00:22:00,320
Just like me. Does your father have Facebook?

402
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,320
Come on. He doesn't have friends.

403
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:03,880
Does he have a girlfriend?

404
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:05,560
Now I'm the one asking a lot of questions.

405
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,320
He's hooked up with Laia, the English teacher.

406
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,960
What? Laia?

407
00:22:15,880 --> 00:22:18,600
Laia. She's a hottie.

408
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,880
-Who's this kid? -He's Pol, a friend.

409
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:23,480
-Hello, ma'm. -Hello.

410
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,960
Your place is very nice.

411
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,760
Neither the place is nice, nor I like to be called "Ma'm."

412
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:32,120
-I'm Calduch. -Yes, I know. You're an "Actor", right?

413
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:36,000
Actor? What do they teach you in school?

414
00:22:36,280 --> 00:22:38,720
May basic general education come back, please.

415
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:39,840
-Actress. -Actress.

416
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:42,320
I saw you in a dip commercial. You were very well.

417
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,450
Beckett, Miller, Brecht.

418
00:22:44,450 --> 00:22:47,600
And you go into History because of a dip commercial.

419
00:23:00,520 --> 00:23:01,640
Hello, Gerard.

420
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:05,640
-What are you doing? -I'm studying.

421
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:07,960
I had an appointment with the lawyer.

422
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,400
We'll sign an agreement with your stupid father very soon.

423
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,040
Mom, please, don't call him "Father."

424
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,360
Look, I bought new clothes to celebrate. Take this, it's yours.

425
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:21,360
-Dammit, they've fallen down. -Did you walk Rufo?

426
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,240
No.

427
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:25,560
-Well, then. Go. -Okay.

428
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,160
Oh, yes. I met Merlí.

429
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:36,480
-What are you saying? What did you do? -Nothing. Relax.

430
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,840
-Just said that I was happy. -Well, I honestly hope so.

431
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:41,840
A new student arrived today.

432
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:48,200
Her name is Mónica, I think. Mónica? Yes, Mónica.

433
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:49,400
And you fell in love.

434
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:51,560
-No! No, no, no. -Sure you did!

435
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,320
-Can you tell? -I know you.

436
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:55,440
You've fallen in love many times.

437
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,760
And I love it. That means you're more excited.

438
00:23:58,200 --> 00:23:59,790
Yes. But I don't want to give it out,

439
00:23:59,790 --> 00:24:01,520
because she doesn't pay attention to me.

440
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,520
But you're the most handsome boy in school.

441
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,800
Mom, I'm not a boy. And handsome. I'm not handsome, either.

442
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,160
You are very cute and that's it!

443
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,280
Well, I'm the cutest kid in the world. Right?

444
00:24:09,920 --> 00:24:11,480
There are others who underestimate us a lot.

445
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,520
Are we going to do that, too?

446
00:24:14,560 --> 00:24:15,540
From now on, we are going

447
00:24:15,540 --> 00:24:17,120
to think that we are worth a lot. Right?

448
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:19,320
-Merlí sent you encouragement. -What?

449
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:22,760
I had some doubts in Philosophy and went to see him

450
00:24:22,840 --> 00:24:23,990
and along the conversation

451
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:26,000
I told him about the mess of your separation.

452
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,480
-But what are you saying, son? -I didn't give details.

453
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,960
What are you doing, telling a teacher our private issues?

454
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:33,000
You tell me to be quiet and you are the first to talk!

455
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,120
He said he's divorced, too, that you should not worry,

456
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,200
because you are going to overcome this. Okay? Come on, Rufo.

457
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:47,120
I'm happy to know everything is all right.

458
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:51,480
Yes, yes. And thank you for calling. I was really moved.

459
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,330
Yes. And that. We should find

460
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:56,280
a chance to go back working together. It's time.

461
00:24:57,520 --> 00:25:00,400
Come on, honey. A kiss. A kiss.

462
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,720
Bye. Bye, bye.

463
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,060
A harpy. But I'd rather stay on good terms,

464
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,840
because she knows the profession.

465
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,040
Pass me the wine.

466
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:12,400
-How was school? -Very well.

467
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,960
Today I met the mother of a student.

468
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:17,600
-And it went well, right? -Yes.

469
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:21,520
-Why are you smiling? -Nothing, nothing. My own stuff.

470
00:25:23,320 --> 00:25:24,320
The boy.

471
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,360
-Hello, handsome. -Hello.

472
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,560
-Your friend didn't stay for dinner? -No.

473
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,560
Man, what a long face!

474
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,200
Eugeni, the teacher of Catalan, gave him a D.

475
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,570
I never failed before and, because of dad,

476
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:38,080
the teacher is picking on me.

477
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,760
Obviously. A D.

478
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:43,440
What do you want me to do? I can't change your grade in the test.

479
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,040
Yes. Nor can you change your temperament. Obvious.

480
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:47,840
It's true. The teacher doesn't like you.

481
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,480
You could make something up to help him.

482
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:51,560
Like what?

483
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,960
I don't know. But do whatever it is for him to pass.

484
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:56,630
-Make the teacher have an accident.

485
00:25:56,630 --> 00:25:58,760
-No, there's no need to go that far.

486
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,280
But you could become friends with Eugeni.

487
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,760
An accident. You're an instigator of evil. You're Lady Macbeth.

488
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:08,200
-Lady what? -Lady Macbeth. Shakespeare, son!

489
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,400
Lady Macbeth. How young I was.

490
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,200
-“I have given such... -There she goes.

491
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:19,800
and know tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me.

492
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:22,280
I would, while it was smiling in my face,

493
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,480
have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums

494
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,520
and dash'd the brains out,

495
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:30,960
had I so sworn as you have done to this!”

496
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:38,240
Police?

497
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,800
Talent.

498
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,840
Machiavelli says the things as they really are.

499
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:06,720
That strength is strength, violence is violence

500
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:08,200
and lie is lie.

501
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:11,360
And there's no need to hide it behind beautiful ideals.

502
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,280
What does it mean "There's no need to hide it"?

503
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:19,400
Definitely, Machiavelli defends evil to save the state.

504
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,240
Tell me, Gerard.

505
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:26,520
There's something that doesn't fit in.

506
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:32,360
Why is it important to save a state that could harm its citizens?

507
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,480
Is it worth saving?

508
00:27:34,560 --> 00:27:37,560
If the ends justify the means, what is it that justify the ends?

509
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:44,600
That's the smartest reflection I've ever heard from a student.

510
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,720
Gery! Very well. You're the best!

511
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,440
Hello.

512
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,720
Hello.

513
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:07,360
-I liked what you said in class. -Really?

514
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:11,400
Because if you don't understand Machiavelli from the start...

515
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:12,600
it's difficult.

516
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:14,600
-Do you like reading? -Yes. Very much.

517
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,200
And what do you read?

518
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:20,880
Well, El Poema del Mío Cid.

519
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:22,460
-That's mandatory reading in Spanish.

520
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:23,680
-Yes. But I like it very much.

521
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,000
Look, do you know this book?

522
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,680
Steppenwolf. Dammit, it sounds good.

523
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:32,440
Really beautiful. I can lend it to you.

524
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,520
-Yes? Well, great. -You tell me if you like it.

525
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:35,640
Okay.

526
00:28:35,960 --> 00:28:37,320
-Bye. -Bye.

527
00:28:42,160 --> 00:28:43,230
Merlí, she liked me.

528
00:28:43,230 --> 00:28:45,720
Mónica talked to me and she lent me this book.

529
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,000
Well, I'm glad.

530
00:28:47,080 --> 00:28:48,360
Let's see if you cheer up a bit,

531
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,270
because the other day you

532
00:28:49,270 --> 00:28:50,600
were depressed with your mother's thing.

533
00:28:50,680 --> 00:28:51,680
Yes, I know.

534
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,920
-By the way, does she work? -Yes. At CosmoCaixa.

535
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,080
-Ah, yes? -Yes.

536
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:56,760
I love sciences. Have a nice day!

537
00:28:56,840 --> 00:28:58,320
-Thank you! -Thank you?

538
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:00,000
Thank you for what?

539
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:02,530
You do favors to others, but nothing for me.

540
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:03,760
Did you talk to Eugeni?

541
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,800
No, and don't insist. Eugeni causes me more rashes than tourists.

542
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:08,890
I have to be fucked off.

543
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,920
You make teachers your enemies and they fail me.

544
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,880
You see that it was not a good idea to have you here?

545
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,840
Just as it's not a good idea to have you at home!

546
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,200
-Bruno! -Dammit! You scared me, Tania!

547
00:29:24,280 --> 00:29:26,000
-How did it go with Pol? -Fine.

548
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,480
And shut up before someone hears you.

549
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,920
Don't be mad at me. I just want what's best for you.

550
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:32,360
Yes? It doesn't look like. Between you and my father...

551
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,440
That's not true!

552
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,320
-“Be careful with Pol. He's not like you." -Don't mock me.

553
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,480
“Don't mock me."

554
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:38,680
Okay.

555
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,960
Pol has always shown that he likes girls,

556
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,720
but as a matter of fact he's in love with you.

557
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:45,800
I'm convinced you're going to live a great love story.

558
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,360
Is this better, my friend? Are you happier?

559
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,240
Can you explain to me what criteria you used to fail Bruno?

560
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:05,200
He didn't know what was necessary for the test.

561
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:09,520
Yes. Listen, Eugeni, don't make come true the saying that goes

562
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,880
that teachers usually pick on some of the students.

563
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:14,480
You and me can pick on each other.

564
00:30:14,560 --> 00:30:17,920
Yes, but this shouldn't have anything to do with Bruno. Okay?

565
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,520
How sweet you are, Merlí.

566
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,700
I like that, because you

567
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:23,680
notice there are teachers who can face you.

568
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:27,440
Some hit you physically, others, fail your son.

569
00:30:27,680 --> 00:30:30,040
So you admit you have unfairly failed him?

570
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:32,760
No. No way. I don't pick on Bruno.

571
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,480
He failed, that's it.

572
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:37,040
Tell little Bergeron

573
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,560
to study harder for the next test the day after tomorrow.

574
00:30:53,480 --> 00:30:55,680
-Hello. -Hello. Have you seen Eugeni?

575
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,240
Just left.

576
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,240
Well, I'm leaving the copies of the Catalan test here.

577
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,080
-Bye. -Bye.

578
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,880
-Hello. -Hello.

579
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:36,520
Don't you have to go tutoring?

580
00:31:36,800 --> 00:31:38,120
Yes, I'm leaving.

581
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:40,080
Take this.

582
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,590
A copy of the Catalan test

583
00:31:41,590 --> 00:31:43,480
that Bruno will have the day after tomorrow.

584
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:46,840
-You see, you could have done something.

585
00:31:46,840 --> 00:31:48,560
-I have it up to here with Bruno.

586
00:31:48,920 --> 00:31:50,660
If he fails because it's my fault,

587
00:31:50,660 --> 00:31:52,360
he threatens to go to his mother.

588
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:54,720
He's upset and says nonsense. He wouldn't go.

589
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,680
There you have it. I have just talked to mom.

590
00:31:57,040 --> 00:31:59,760
-I'm going to Rome and maybe stay there. -What the hell.

591
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:00,840
You can't go now!

592
00:32:00,920 --> 00:32:02,720
No? Mom is already buying me a ticket for tomorrow.

593
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:04,960
You have a test! Besides, your father...

594
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:07,760
No! No! Let him go, let him go! I'm tired of you!

595
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,600
You're in a giant hormone and it doesn't let you think clearly!

596
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:12,560
-Do you want to go to Rome? -Yes! So I don't see you!

597
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,640
Well, then, go and stop pestering me!

598
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,680
The janitor said a mother of a junior is waiting for you.

599
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:23,880
Thank you.

600
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:26,920
Don't thank me. I'm doing a favor to the janitor, not to you.

601
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,360
-Albert, please. -I wouldn't have come close to you.

602
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:34,160
Albert, I know I made a mistake and I understand you're upset,

603
00:32:34,240 --> 00:32:37,440
but you don't have to treat me like shit.

604
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,200
-Tell me that in English. -Come again?

605
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:41,810
You know how I get when we're

606
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:43,440
fucking and you speak in English in my ear.

607
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:44,720
Talk to me in English.

608
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,960
Don't talk to me like that, least of all here.

609
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,280
You'd have liked that I said it.

610
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:53,080
I'm doing just like Merlí. I say the things in your face.

611
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,440
-Fearless, not biting my tongue. -Come on, please. Let's talk.

612
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:01,200
Yes. You want to talk to me, but you want to fuck him!

613
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:02,520
Laia, fuck you!

614
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,840
Gee. It must have taken you hours.

615
00:33:19,520 --> 00:33:20,520
Computer

616
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,880
Now you're back to not talking?

617
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:29,320
Yes, man. Yes.

618
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:37,300
Your mother told me you spend

619
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:40,000
all day reading newspapers on the Internet.

620
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,400
What subjects are you interested in?

621
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,840
All

622
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:54,600
No. We can't talk about the real world if you don't talk.

623
00:33:57,040 --> 00:34:00,200
You know what? I don't feel like teaching, either.

624
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,400
Do you know what I'd rather do?

625
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:05,520
I'd rather go visit a very nice lady I met the other day,

626
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,240
instead of staying here with Harpo Marx.

627
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:13,680
What lady?

628
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,560
Yes, man. I'll tell you.

629
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,440
Go to her

630
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:28,120
You want me to go so you can go back to the Internet.

631
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,120
You're a manipulator.

632
00:34:33,080 --> 00:34:34,360
I like you.

633
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:45,360
Bye

634
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:47,080
Well, listen. I don't intend to go.

635
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:00,240
You only...

636
00:35:06,920 --> 00:35:08,320
You only have one life.

637
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,840
-Merlí? -The mother of Gerard.

638
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,340
-Gina, yes. We talked yesterday.

639
00:36:43,340 --> 00:36:44,720
-We did. So? What are you doing here?

640
00:36:45,040 --> 00:36:48,080
Working. I'm the coordinator of educational activities.

641
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,480
-Really? -Yes.

642
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,600
Really? Very well, very well.

643
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,920
Strange how I never saw you around. I come here often.

644
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,000
-You do? -Yes.

645
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,720
-Have you worked here long? -Five years.

646
00:37:00,360 --> 00:37:02,280
You say you come here often?

647
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:06,480
Yes. I used to bring Bruno, my son. Now he doesn't want to come.

648
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,680
-Now they don't want us tagging along. -Right.

649
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:19,280
Well... Listen, Gerard is a very smart kid.

650
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:20,360
Is he?

651
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:22,520
He's shown interest for my class. That says a lot about him.

652
00:37:22,600 --> 00:37:24,100
On the other hand, his mother

653
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:26,280
sees Philosophy as a minor subject, right?

654
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:29,960
Yes.

655
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:34,160
Well, I'm sorry. But I wish you luck. I'd rather go.

656
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:35,820
No, no, I have a break now.

657
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,600
If you feel like, we can have some coffee.

658
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:38,800
There's a little veranda.

659
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,400
I'm sorry. I have an appointment. I'm sorry. No, I have to go.

660
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,640
We'll meet again.

661
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,760
-Bye. -Bye.

662
00:37:50,080 --> 00:37:52,200
"What, Gertrude? How is Hamlet?"

663
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:53,400
"Mad!

664
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:56,360
As the see and wind, when both contend which is the mightier.

665
00:37:56,640 --> 00:38:00,520
-In his... In his..." -“Lawless fit.”

666
00:38:00,600 --> 00:38:02,200
Shut up! I knew it!

667
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,960
"In his lawless fit, he feels... He feels that..."

668
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:15,160
Listen, let's take five. I know, but right now I can't.

669
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:19,240
My memory would suit you well in the Catalan test.

670
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,760
-I'm not doing it. I'm going away. -You should stay.

671
00:38:24,920 --> 00:38:26,880
The Catalan test.

672
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,130
Your father took it. He didn't give you,

673
00:38:32,130 --> 00:38:34,480
because you're obsessed about going.

674
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:38,280
But I think that, since we have it...

675
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,400
-I could scream now. -Spare me.

676
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,000
You force me to be smarter than you are!

677
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:49,320
You have a high sense of ethics.

678
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,840
Over the years, one loses it.

679
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:55,360
And lacks sense of humor.

680
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:58,880
You should have more, now that you are in love.

681
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,880
-What did you say? -You never talk about it.

682
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:04,760
But you surely have a lot to say.

683
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,200
It's the same with your father.

684
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,640
-Is he in love? -I'd say he is.

685
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:13,360
-With whom? -I don't know.

686
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,000
It doesn't matter, as long as he is.

687
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,400
Enjoy it, Bruno.

688
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:26,520
Use the test and, above all, let love flow.

689
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:30,440
"Spread thy close curtain,

690
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:36,480
love performing night, that runaway's eyes may wink

691
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,240
and Romeo leap into these arms, untalk'd of and unseen."

692
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:45,160
Granny, honestly,

693
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:48,200
don't you think there's too much drama in this house?

694
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,800
There's one missing. I counted three times.

695
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:56,240
Why doesn't the janitor make the copies?

696
00:39:56,360 --> 00:39:58,000
Octavi is still sick.

697
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:02,480
Nobody comes.

698
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,560
We offer them the opportunity to solve problems.

699
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,920
You know how kids are.

700
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,340
-You're a very good teacher,

701
00:40:12,340 --> 00:40:14,120
Mireia. -You haven't seen me teaching.

702
00:40:14,520 --> 00:40:16,240
I don't need to. I can tell.

703
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:20,240
Thank you.

704
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,720
I have to call the sitter, after this. I left the kids with her.

705
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:29,680
Is your husband at work?

706
00:40:31,200 --> 00:40:35,920
Yes. He's a graphic designer, but he needs his free time.

707
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:40,120
What about you? Don't you need free time?

708
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:48,280
Listen, if you want, go make the copy.

709
00:40:48,720 --> 00:40:52,360
Not now. Later. I'll make it.

710
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:56,120
Then I'll make the call now, if you don't mind.

711
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:58,760
Okay. I'm going.

712
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:11,600
I don't like that the other teachers look at me badly.

713
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:13,920
Especially Mireia and Eugeni.

714
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:16,480
No way.

715
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,370
-What about Albert? Did he talk to you?

716
00:41:22,370 --> 00:41:23,960
-Let's not talk about him.

717
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:26,520
Are you all right?

718
00:41:28,080 --> 00:41:29,920
You're very quiet. What's the matter?

719
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:32,440
Nothing.

720
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:35,440
Does it hurt?

721
00:41:45,040 --> 00:41:46,120
What's wrong?

722
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,960
Nothing.

723
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,640
Are you reading?

724
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:14,040
Steppenwolf. But I don't understand anything.

725
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,680
Mónica lent it to me.

726
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:19,160
You see how handsome you are, you fool. She likes you.

727
00:42:19,440 --> 00:42:20,640
We're friends, that's it.

728
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:25,040
And how was it? Did you talk to her, or did she talk to you?

729
00:42:26,080 --> 00:42:27,720
Merlí advised me.

730
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,560
Merlí told you how to flirt? Teachers don't do such a thing.

731
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,400
I asked him.

732
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,040
He's very self-assured. You know he likes sciences?

733
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,320
-Really? -Yes.

734
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,080
-I told him you work at CosmoCaixa. -You told him?

735
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,960
-Shouldn't I? -When did you tell him that?

736
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,560
-This morning. Why? -No, nothing. Nothing.

737
00:42:47,240 --> 00:42:48,760
Read. Read.

738
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:14,400
Hello, Iván.

739
00:43:16,080 --> 00:43:17,600
The house is pretty clean.

740
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:20,200
Did you do it yourself?

741
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:29,400
Today there were few people at the bar. I don't understand.

742
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:33,600
It was calm. Usually, I never stop.

743
00:43:39,800 --> 00:43:41,050
Tomorrow morning I'll wake up earlier.

744
00:43:41,050 --> 00:43:42,080
A supplier is supposed to come.

745
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:52,000
Mom...

746
00:43:54,360 --> 00:43:56,200
Yes. Tell me.

747
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:04,240
A man... in the United States, was released from jail

748
00:44:07,240 --> 00:44:08,800
because they found out he was innocent.

749
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,240
He was charged for the murder of a little girl.

750
00:44:19,400 --> 00:44:21,840
He spent 30 years imprisoned in vain.

751
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:29,960
Why do these things happen?

752
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:05,960
Did you call me?

753
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:10,800
I have the questions of the catalan test

754
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:15,360
Wow! No kidding. How come?

755
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:22,440
I can't tell. Do you want to study tomorrow at my place?

756
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:28,440
Sure, man!

757
00:45:28,520 --> 00:45:34,560
You can stay and sleep here if you want

758
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:07,960
“He who seeks to deceive will always find

759
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,640
them who allow themselves to be deceived."

760
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:40,360
Yes! I'm sleeping there and we'll have an a plus! Go, go, go!

761
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,680
“I don't follow Philosophy syllabi I haven't written.

762
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:16,640
You can use the syllabus to wipe your ass."

763
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,640
Are we supposed not to overdo it in the test?

764
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,080
A B plus is enough.

765
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:26,840
-No, man, no! -No?

766
00:47:26,920 --> 00:47:29,480
No. We have the questions. We have to go for the A plus.

767
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:31,360
The other day, how many copies did you make?

768
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:32,960
-Of your test? -Yes.

769
00:47:33,040 --> 00:47:33,840
Twenty-five.

770
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:36,080
When you left the copies in the faculty room,

771
00:47:36,160 --> 00:47:37,280
was there anyone there?

772
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:38,440
Yes, Merlí was there.

773
00:47:39,840 --> 00:47:41,760
Some people find comfort telling themselves that happiness

774
00:47:41,840 --> 00:47:43,480
is in the small things.

775
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:46,360
It's really trendy to talk about the coffee aroma in the morning,

776
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:49,040
about birds singing. Bullshit. That's not happiness.

777
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:51,720
Merlí, are you all right? Do you want me to call someone?

778
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,160
A copy of the Catalan test was missing. You're suspected.

779
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:58,720
Since a copy is missing, I should be the one who took it?

780
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:00,160
Granny gave me the test.

781
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,600
You have the balls of a Prussian officer.

782
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:04,240
-Did someone see you? -No, nobody. But...

783
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:06,160
So you have to completely deny it.

784
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:07,720
I've decided to talk to Toni.

785
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:10,160
Do you want to lose your son and your job?

786
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:11,320
You turn me on.

787
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:14,600
How dare you? Let's pretend this didn't happen, okay?

788
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:20,920
-Did you touch me? -No, man.

789
00:48:21,360 --> 00:48:22,360
I'm leaving.

790
00:48:22,440 --> 00:48:23,800
Pol, Pol, I didn't touch you, man!
