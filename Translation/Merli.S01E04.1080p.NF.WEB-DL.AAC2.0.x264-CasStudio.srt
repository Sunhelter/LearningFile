1
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:14,240
His masterpiece "Loneliness", from 1905.

2
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,920
-I am the master. I'll get ten points.

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:19,520
-Well, we have the questions.

4
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:25,080
We should hide that fact in the test. An eight is enough.

5
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:26,960
-No, man. -No?

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:29,720
We have the questions. Let's go for a ten.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:32,760
Why don't you tell me how you got this?

8
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,280
-I can't. -I can imagine who helped you.

9
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,240
You'd better sleep here. We have to study until late.

10
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:45,730
I argued with my father

11
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:48,080
because he didn't want to pick up my grandmother.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,400
-Isn't she his mother? -She is on my mother's side.

13
00:00:53,560 --> 00:00:55,000
She surely has asked for me.

14
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,760
Let's go.

15
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:00,960
Hey, a selfie. Studying to get a ten.

16
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,120
"Cheese!"

17
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,880
Damn, my favorite student in my house, and in pajamas.

18
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,760
-What do you want, dad? -Nothing. I just came to say goodnight.

19
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,360
-You don't need to. -Then, go. Study.

20
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,080
-Close the door. -Yes, so no one can see you.

21
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,360
-So, let's sleep? -Go ahead. I'll review this.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,360
You haven't made out with a girl in a long time, have you?

23
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,920
-A year or so. -You should get another one soon.

24
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,200
At the moment, I don't like any girl.

25
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,640
-But you don't ever stop. -I can't complain.

26
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,040
How many girls have you been with?

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,040
Pol...

28
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,720
It's that I...

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,000
You, what?

30
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,760
I'm sleepy.

31
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,560
I'll go to sleep.

32
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,920
Actually, Bruno didn't want to leave.

33
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,320
He told me, when you were gone. He just wanted to tease you.

34
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,680
He is a bit like you.

35
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:35,640
Listen, that boy, Pol, is he the son of that woman you like?

36
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:38,360
Where did you get the idea that I like someone?

37
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:41,360
You were happy when you told me that you met a student's mother.

38
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,040
When you talk about students' mothers, it's never something good.

39
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,120
-You get it, eh? -Are you still with Laia?

40
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:50,680
Yes.

41
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:56,080
With Gina, it's different. Things go at a slower pace.

42
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:59,160
Gina! Sounds good.

43
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,840
But it surprises me that you are so slow.

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,920
Soon everything will speed up.

45
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,160
I'll tell her I'm attracted to her and that I like her very much.

46
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,960
Now you remind me of your father.

47
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:20,200
-You haven't talked about dad for years. -That Gina is promising.

48
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,160
What are you doing?

49
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,600
I just took your notes, so they don't bother you.

50
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:34,280
-Did you touch me? -No, man!

51
00:04:34,760 --> 00:04:37,160
-I'm leaving. -Pol! Pol! I didn't touch you.

52
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,120
Now I know why you don't hook up with any girl!

53
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:41,920
Okay! I did touch you, but it was a joke, Pol.

54
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:45,840
I swear.

55
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,520
-Can I sleep in peace? -Sure!

56
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:10,680
Your father's first payment has arrived.

57
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,080
Cool.

58
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,200
But it's not what we had agreed. Your 200 euros are missing.

59
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,920
-He transferred it to me. -What?

60
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,320
I asked him to. It's mine. I want to leave it in my account.

61
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,720
No, you are not 18 yet. You cannot manage a pension.

62
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,440
The pension you charged already includes my expenses.

63
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,000
This one is a bonus, a kind of allowance dad gave me.

64
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,280
You call him dad, now? How intimate.

65
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:36,320
I don't want to see him. I just care about the money.

66
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,880
Transfer it to me now. I'm the one in charge of the money.

67
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,720
-If you don't, I'll report it. -I asked him to do it.

68
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,720
No. That's not what we agreed to.

69
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,560
I don't want you wasting 200 euros.

70
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,840
You wanted to read dad the riot act, right?

71
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,200
You won. You have what you wanted. So do I.

72
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,360
I don't want you to have so much money, damn.

73
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,880
could make you understand? You listen to him.

74
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,400
Don't go to my school. The teachers will think you're a pain.

75
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:02,000
Okay. I won't go. Are you happy? I won't go.

76
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,520
But you have to transfer it to me.

77
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,520
You came to congratulate me again?

78
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:09,360
No, I came to ask for your help, if you don't mind.

79
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,800
No, I'm getting used to your surprise visits.

80
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,880
-How about your visit to the museum? -It was just a coincidence.

81
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:19,480
Sure. Listen, I got a pension of 200 euros for Gerard.

82
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,440
His father will give it to him every month.

83
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:25,560
-But he had it transferred to him. -So what?

84
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,720
He is underage. I should be in charge of the money.

85
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,320
Sorry for saying this, but I think you're a bit naive.

86
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,400
What?

87
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:39,480
What did you expect? It's his money, he won't give it to you.

88
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,320
He is no longer a child. I don't think I can help you.

89
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:45,240
You are a father. Would you give Bruno 200 euros a month?

90
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:48,520
-Don't be crazy. -So why did you call me naive and crazy.

91
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,140
You got yourself in this mess.

92
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,040
You wanted to exploit your ex, right?

93
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:56,240
You had what you wanted. But you didn't foresee this detail.

94
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,880
Shall we go to the bar next door and talk calmly?

95
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,560
I don't think so. I'm leaving. Don't tell Gerard I came.

96
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,280
Pol Rubio, as always, the first one to finish.

97
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,280
-Pol, how did it go? -What do you think?

98
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:01,680
You handed it over too soon. I think Hitler will suspect.

99
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:03,760
Let him suspect. I did study.

100
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:09,240
I know that you studied. Listen, last night it was a joke.

101
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,520
I don't know why you put it that way. We are friends.

102
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,640
As long as you don't touch me.

103
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,480
So, according to Aristotle, man is a social being.

104
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,040
Which certainly will be on the test.

105
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:28,920
-But... -It is too much!

106
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,720
Keep silent. According to Aristotle,

107
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,000
without friends, you can't reach eudaimonia.

108
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,520
In Greek, eudaimonia means happiness.

109
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,160
To Aristotle, life's goal is the pursuit of happiness.

110
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:47,520
Nowadays, we have turned it into an unhealthy obsession.

111
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,400
We think it is a right we have, not an aspiration,

112
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,880
and that leads to frustration.

113
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:56,040
Some say happiness is in little things.

114
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,920
The new fad is to talk about the coffee's smell,

115
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,600
about the singing birds... Bullshit. That's not happiness.

116
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:07,640
Who in here is happy?

117
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,080
Gerard.

118
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,360
Well, I am. In general, everything is going well for me.

119
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
-Good. -But not always.

120
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:22,400
-In general? -Yes, in general.

121
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,520
To Aristotle, happiness is not a state. It's an activity.

122
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,240
It's only at the end of life

123
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,880
you can say whether you are happy or not.

124
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:38,600
Do you want to be happy? Aristotle says you have to work for it.

125
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,760
-What? -That we have to work for happiness?

126
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,560
Work is fucking slavery.

127
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,060
Just look at people getting

128
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:51,400
on the subway everyday, they look miserable.

129
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,200
I don't know. Can you be happy working?

130
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,240
You got half a point in the exam.

131
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,240
Let's go, bull!

132
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:03,080
That's what I want you to do. Thinking. Questioning.

133
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,000
For the next class, you have to write on a piece of paper

134
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:10,280
what do you think of happiness.

135
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,100
-Does it have to be long?

136
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,120
-It could be one sentence. And anonymous.

137
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,440
Gerard, take this. Because everything is going well for you,

138
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:18,880
you're in charge of collecting the papers.

139
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:26,000
-Can you change it on Thursday? -Again, Gloria?

140
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:26,910
It would help me a lot.

141
00:10:26,910 --> 00:10:28,520
I'm in charge of something else on Thursday.

142
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,640
But we had agreed that on Thursday. Another thing, Gloria.

143
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,120
-Yes. -How many copies did you make?

144
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,560
-For your exam? -Yes.

145
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,040
-Twenty five. -Are you sure? Because I counted only 24.

146
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,560
How strange. I'm sure I made 25.

147
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,280
-Are you sure? -Eugeni!

148
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,280
And when you left the copies at the staffroom, was anyone there?

149
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,320
Eugeni, it's impossible.

150
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,920
If someone stole the test, you'll know when you see the grades.

151
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,240
-Slow down. -Thank you, Gloria.

152
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:00,800
You can't be sure about it.

153
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:16,640
-Hello. -Hello, Joan. Come in.

154
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:20,600
What's up? Tell me.

155
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,280
At the end, you didn't explain

156
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:24,640
the topic of justice according to Aristotle.

157
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,560
-And because it will be on the exam...

158
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:28,360
-Yes, I'll explain in class tomorrow.

159
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:31,960
Okay. Then, that's all.

160
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:34,320
Since you're here, sit down.

161
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,680
Look.

162
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,680
Justice is a medium term between two ends.

163
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:49,960
Each end is the injustice.

164
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,480
It is unfair that you commit injustice on someone...

165
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:58,080
or that you allow someone to commit injustice on you.

166
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:03,080
-Okay. -In the middle, is the justice.

167
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:09,200
-And without justice, there's no euda... -Eudaimonia.

168
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:14,720
-Have you ever been unfair to someone? -No.

169
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:17,520
Was someone unfair to you?

170
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,840
-I'll come back later. -No, I'm leaving.

171
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,560
We'll talk later, right?

172
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,160
Man, it's a classic.

173
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,080
I'm not used to reading these things.

174
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:39,120
Do you know if there is a movie about it?

175
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,840
Your mother came.

176
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:43,880
Fuck.

177
00:12:43,960 --> 00:12:46,880
She is very worried about the money you get each month.

178
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,280
She asked me to talk with you.

179
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,900
What is she doing? Why did she come?

180
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,200
As always, I don't understand.

181
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,280
Gerard, look. I think you're right.

182
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,880
It's your money and you can do whatever you want with it.

183
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,680
I will just tell you one word. Sophrosyne.

184
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,160
In Greek, it means moderation.

185
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,440
Now, leave. I had enough of teenagers for today.

186
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,840
"Sophro...

187
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:17,080
-nesis"? -Sophrosyne.

188
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,040
Okay.

189
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,520
Hello.

190
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,000
What have you bought?

191
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,880
-This brand is very expensive, Gerard. -So what?

192
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:02,640
-He told you? -Why did you tell him private matters?

193
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:03,900
Look who's talking. You

194
00:14:03,900 --> 00:14:05,640
asked him for advice about how to fuck a girl.

195
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:08,920
Mom, please. Those words are not words a mother would say.

196
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,600
What do you know about it? I'm young, too, and I say what I want.

197
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:15,800
The fact that you talk like that surprises me.

198
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:21,080
No one can tell me how to talk, let alone a kid.

199
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,240
The money is mine and I can do whatever I want.

200
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,720
He told you that?

201
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
You manage your money. I'll manage mine.

202
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:42,680
-Kid, how was the exam? -Fine. Goodnight, grandma.

203
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,940
I suppose you don't expect

204
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,760
me to clean up your friend's bed, right?

205
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,400
-No. -Goodnight.

206
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,640
Goodnight.

207
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:31,240
Pol and Bruno's exams are perfect.

208
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,720
Someone has stolen the Catalan exam.

209
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,560
Wait. They have perfect grades and you think that...

210
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:45,680
I asked Gloria to make 25 copies. She left them in the staffroom.

211
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,690
When I counted them, one was missing.

212
00:15:47,690 --> 00:15:49,520
At that moment, I didn't care much.

213
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:50,920
But she told me when she

214
00:15:50,920 --> 00:15:53,520
left the copies on the table, at the staffroom,

215
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:57,280
there was only one person there.

216
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:01,680
-Guess who. -Come on, Eugeni. We don't have time.

217
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,600
You know perfectly who I'm talking about.

218
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,560
I corrected Bruno and Pol's exams and they got perfect marks.

219
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:11,760
What if they did study?

220
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,860
Come on, Toni. I'm not naive.

221
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:16,400
You know what kind of student Pol is.

222
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:19,360
And Bruno never gets more than a six. To me, it's very obvious.

223
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:22,290
The father took the exam, gave to his son.

224
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,880
Then, he shared with a friend.

225
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,320
-I don't know. I don't know. -What don't you know?

226
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,920
-Do you have any evidence? -Do you need more proof?

227
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:42,400
Did anyone see him take the exam? I can't accuse him like that.

228
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,600
I also think that he may be guilty.

229
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,960
But let's be serious, Eugeni. I will investigate.

230
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:52,640
You will investigate.

231
00:16:56,840 --> 00:17:01,520
-What a surprise! -Why did you tell Gerard I came?

232
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,250
I asked you to keep it secret.

233
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,280
I don't want you to come between me and my son.

234
00:17:05,360 --> 00:17:07,280
Much less to put him against me.

235
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:11,520
I see that I'm no longer a brilliant teacher

236
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:13,120
but the contrary.

237
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:16,680
You're funny, really. I think it's nice that you help him.

238
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,000
But I don't want you to boycott me as a mother. Are we clear?

239
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:20,960
Crystal clear.

240
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:23,400
Do you have a piece of paper?

241
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,680
-Yes, this is good. -This?

242
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:37,320
It's my phone number. If you have any other complaints, call me.

243
00:17:38,120 --> 00:17:39,800
So that Gerard won't see you here.

244
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:42,280
I'll consider it as one of your outbursts.

245
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:53,080
Congratulations. You've got perfect marks in Catalan.

246
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,390
Pol, this is the first

247
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:55,960
perfect grade you've got since I've known you.

248
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,600
You went from failing to getting a ten.

249
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,760
-Not bad. -I'm happy.

250
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:08,000
You knew the questions on the exam.

251
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,480
No. We studied at my house until late.

252
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,380
We didn't want to fail again,

253
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,920
so we decided to try our best studying.

254
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:17,680
How come you took so much time to decide that, Pol?

255
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,360
I decided it now. So what?

256
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:24,560
You failed two classes. You could have decided earlier, right?

257
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,920
Well, no. I did it now.

258
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,360
Right.

259
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:35,520
So none of you came to the staffroom and took Eugeni's exam.

260
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:37,720
No.

261
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,920
Do you have any idea who it could've been?

262
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:51,040
Pol, you can go.

263
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:06,800
I want to get to the end of this story, Bruno.

264
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,920
Because I think you are hiding some information.

265
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:17,000
Did someone you know steal the exam?

266
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,640
Someone close to you?

267
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:27,360
No.

268
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:35,960
-So do I. -I don't see it clearly.

269
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:38,240
What he did in the exam is one thing, but...

270
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:41,760
I also think it's too much. Stealing an exam?

271
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:43,100
-He took Albert's girlfriend.

272
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:44,720
-Damn, Eugeni, what's wrong with you?

273
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
And Bruno got a ten. All fits.

274
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:50,520
Does it? It could have been

275
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,320
Come on, Santi. When Gloria

276
00:19:56,840 --> 00:19:58,080
It was easy for him to take one.

277
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:00,760
It won't be the first time a student steals a test.

278
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:06,560
You know what is the most probable? That it was him.

279
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:08,880
What are you talking about?

280
00:20:12,560 --> 00:20:14,520
We believe the Catalan exam was stolen.

281
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,160
How can you believe this man? The first thing he did here,

282
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,280
upon arrival, was breaking your relationship with Albert.

283
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,200
-Eugeni. -Be careful with what you say.

284
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,800
Forgive me.

285
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:37,000
If it is proved that it was him, then he can't continue teaching.

286
00:20:40,760 --> 00:20:42,200
Right?

287
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,080
A copy of the Catalan exam is missing. They suspect you.

288
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,840
A copy missing and I must be the one who took it?

289
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,760
-Grandma gave me the exam. -Son of a bitch.

290
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,800
Toni cornered Pol and I, but we denied everything.

291
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,520
Now, they'll go after you.

292
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:01,320
She said she didn't. But why the fuck did your grandma do it?

293
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,480
-Because maybe she's like you.

294
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,800
-No one saw me. There's no evidence.

295
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,420
Dad. You're living evidence.

296
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:09,520
Who else can be a suspect, the janitor?

297
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:14,600
-Why? Did you two fail? -No, we have perfect scores.

298
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:17,340
You're idiots. You had the questions,

299
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:19,400
you should have played it off.

300
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:22,320
You could've tried a six or a seven.

301
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:24,200
And now we have to cover it up for you.

302
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,600
If you get out of this one, I will believe in God.

303
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,000
Fuck.

304
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,400
Pol told them.

305
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:38,840
I believe it. He is the only teacher who could have done that.

306
00:21:39,040 --> 00:21:41,280
I told you he was a moron.

307
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,200
He can be cool with the students, but he can't fool me.

308
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,360
-He's the best teacher we have. -Sure.

309
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:48,480
What if Bruno stole the exam?

310
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:49,720
What are you saying, Marc?

311
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,520
Bruno isn't capable of stealing an exam.

312
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,400
Bruno! You could have given me the exam.

313
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,760
What?

314
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,160
I would have done fucking great if I had the questions.

315
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:02,480
How cool of your dad. Stealing the exam from Hitler.

316
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:05,880
Are you a moron? Why did you say that?

317
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:08,400
My father hasn't done anything.

318
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:10,040
If you spread that lie, he'll get fired.

319
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:12,360
Tell that to Pol. He told us.

320
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:14,760
Where is Pol?

321
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:33,080
Oh, tighter. Good. Good.

322
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,070
Finally, someone who knows

323
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,200
how to fix the pants without pricking me.

324
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,280
I want her here in the next play.

325
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,160
Would you like to be my personal assistant?

326
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:45,520
Yes, of course. It is an honor to me.

327
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,000
Honey, an honor? How classic.

328
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:56,000
Yes, it's me. You have the balls of a Prussian officer.

329
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:57,560
Girl, leave me alone.

330
00:22:57,640 --> 00:22:59,200
Smoking is not allowed in here.

331
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:01,120
Do you mind putting out the cigarette?

332
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:04,360
Oh, how cute. Why don't you go fuck yourself?

333
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,760
You gave Bruno the exam.

334
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:11,000
That kid sometimes forgets what a secret is.

335
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:12,880
I did it so he wouldn't go to Rome.

336
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,610
It didn't occur to you that you

337
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:16,880
should have told him not to get a perfect score?

338
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:18,920
He could've thought of it himself.

339
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,720
I don't know what's wrong with this family.

340
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,400
We're always drawing attention to ourselves.

341
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,480
Okay, I'll say I was the one that stole the exam. Period.

342
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,080
-Did someone see you? -No one.

343
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,200
Didn't you say you don't want problems but solutions?

344
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,240
The solution is to confess.

345
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:35,280
No way. You won't confess anything.

346
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:38,160
Everyone thinks it was me. No one else could have done that.

347
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,840
I'll talk to Toni, I've decided.

348
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:43,000
Do you want to lose your son just like you lost your job?

349
00:23:43,280 --> 00:23:45,920
Listen to me as if it was the last thing you did in your life.

350
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,800
The mistake has been made. Okay, we have to sort it out.

351
00:23:50,680 --> 00:23:52,080
I will take care of Bruno.

352
00:23:53,240 --> 00:23:56,360
-I will ask him to say it was him. -No, no, no.

353
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,440
Don't get Bruno into this. They will expel him.

354
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:02,720
It's the only solution. And listen to me.

355
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,200
Deny everything. Completely. And go further. Get angry.

356
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:10,360
Intensely. Defend yourself and say:

357
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:14,960
"It's a very serious accusation you're making against me."

358
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:19,080
Mom, you just recreated a dramatic atmosphere.

359
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,070
This is the only way you'll

360
00:24:20,070 --> 00:24:21,560
get them to doubt what they already suspect.

361
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,400
You're always so dramatic.

362
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:25,920
Tell me if you didn't come here to ask for this advice.

363
00:24:35,280 --> 00:24:36,080
-You told the whole class?

364
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,280
-What are you saying? I only told Marc.

365
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:39,240
Everyone knows. Do you want them to sack my father?

366
00:24:39,320 --> 00:24:40,280
You should be happy because

367
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:41,680
I didn't say anything about last night.

368
00:24:42,400 --> 00:24:43,520
I don't know how you got the

369
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,680
questions but you got into this because you wanted it.

370
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:49,120
If you bust my balls, I'll go to Toni and tell him everything.

371
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,680
Weren't we friends?

372
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,160
Not the way you wanted.

373
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,080
-What are you looking at? -He knows, doesn't he?

374
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:04,920
Yes, he does. You're a heavy burden in every way.

375
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:06,000
Are you calling me fat?

376
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,800
Yes, I am. You're a fat bitch who won't stop stuffing her face.

377
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:13,880
Toni, I'm shocked that you accuse me without evidence.

378
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,720
-I'm only asking you. -No, you're sure that I did it.

379
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:19,080
Who do you want me to suspect? Eugeni doesn't like you.

380
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,640
He didn't like you since the first day.

381
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,330
Gloria swears when she left the copies,

382
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,560
you were the only one in the room.

383
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:25,410
And why is everyone so

384
00:25:25,410 --> 00:25:29,040
sure that there were 25 copies instead of 24?

385
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,570
Bruno got a perfect score.

386
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:33,040
So did Pol. Before, they had only bad marks.

387
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:36,240
Damn. They went to your house to study. Everything seems...

388
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,680
There is no evidence because

389
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,720
it is impossible. I didn't steal anything.

390
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:43,880
If you did it, you would have no right to continue teaching here.

391
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,160
Don't you believe me?

392
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:50,040
You don't need to threaten to fire me. I'm leaving now.

393
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,160
-Wait, no. -No, I will give my last class today.

394
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:57,120
No. I can't go in the staffroom

395
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,880
knowing everyone thinks I have stolen an exam from a co-worker.

396
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,430
Someday, you will know the truth.

397
00:26:03,430 --> 00:26:05,520
And will understand you have wronged me.

398
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:13,800
-I thought of you today. -Raspberries, I know they are expensive.

399
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,200
Only for today.

400
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:20,810
I see you're upset about the exam thing.

401
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,280
I've made a mistake giving it to you.

402
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,360
Your father didn't want to do that.

403
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,720
But you had decided to go away.

404
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:29,080
He stole it, didn't he? He has to pay for it.

405
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:33,240
No, you're right. He has to confess.

406
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,590
Yes. So this nightmare will end.

407
00:26:35,590 --> 00:26:37,840
Another teacher would come. More boring.

408
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:39,760
I am so sorry.

409
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,360
He'll be unemployed again.

410
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,760
Hard times are on their way. You'll be suspended for a few days.

411
00:26:52,840 --> 00:26:55,400
-That's not bad. -No, it's not.

412
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:57,840
Compared to what they will do to your father.

413
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,760
I don't want him to be unemployed, Bruno.

414
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:06,920
Neither do I. But what do you want me to do?

415
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,520
You can't think of anything?

416
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:21,720
Grandma, take it. I don't want them poisoned.

417
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,280
You deserve an Oscar.

418
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,480
They will open disciplinary file for you, at most!

419
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:26,670
I won't confess that it was me.

420
00:27:26,670 --> 00:27:27,960
I didn't force you to be a criminal.

421
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:29,360
But you did benefit from it.

422
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:31,680
You were so happy with your friend studying here.

423
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,360
Assume your part of responsibility.

424
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,360
And he should assume his. And I will no longer see him at school.

425
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:40,280
Is that what you really want? Your father is happy at work.

426
00:27:40,360 --> 00:27:42,560
He needs to do that. It is his passion!

427
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:45,160
It's true that he made a mistake.

428
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,520
Maybe, he doesn't deserve it.

429
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:51,600
But I ask you to do this for your dad.

430
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:57,680
Bruno, say it was you and everything will fit.

431
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,520
Come on.

432
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,680
Come in.

433
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:27,160
Nice shirt. Is it new?

434
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:29,160
Yes. It's new.

435
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,080
Well,

436
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,520
I guess you know about what happened with Eugeni Bosch's exam.

437
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,000
I have to tell you that today is my last day here.

438
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:53,480
I can't allow the principle to suspect that I stole an exam.

439
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:59,200
It would not be good for either you or me.

440
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:02,800
But be glad, this isn't the end of the world.

441
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:06,000
-About Eudaimonia... -Wait. You're leaving?

442
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,240
Yes, it is decided Gerard, can you give me the bag?

443
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,600
Thank you.

444
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:17,520
Let's see what you think about happiness, peripatetics.

445
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:25,880
"I would be happier if my father stopped annoying me."

446
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,720
Bruno, I'm touched.

447
00:29:32,400 --> 00:29:33,840
Well, this says:

448
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:37,920
"Happiness is impossible to get". Wow!

449
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,720
"I was happy when I was little." Not bad.

450
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:03,120
This one is not anonymous, and it says:

451
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:08,520
"Without money, life sucks. There's no happiness." Pol Rubio.

452
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:14,120
So, you'll sit here waiting to win the lottery or what?

453
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,600
I have won the lottery, but not the one with money.

454
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:18,920
Which one?

455
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:22,000
The family I have. We don't choose them.

456
00:30:24,560 --> 00:30:25,960
You're right about that.

457
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,840
But Pol, there are families who have money and they aren't happy.

458
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,690
Have you ever wondered how

459
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,400
it would be if you were born in another family?

460
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:47,360
I'm surprised. He tells you anything and you believe him. Bravo.

461
00:30:48,160 --> 00:30:49,760
Don't you see he made himself the victim?

462
00:30:50,040 --> 00:30:53,240
He said he would stop teaching, let him leave.

463
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,160
Will you teach Philosophy?

464
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,600
Talk to the department. A teacher just quit.

465
00:30:57,720 --> 00:30:59,960
I need this to be solved as soon as possible.

466
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,440
I don't want this to affect the students.

467
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:03,640
Do you really think it wasn't him?

468
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,480
I think it could be him but I have my doubts.

469
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,680
You have doubts?

470
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,000
Excuse me, Toni. A student wants to talk to you.

471
00:31:10,160 --> 00:31:11,160
Now?

472
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,680
About the stolen exam.

473
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:39,280
I want you to understand that if you don't trust me, I'll leave.

474
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,680
-Listen, no. -No, I have decided.

475
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,000
The culprit confessed. I've just talked to him.

476
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:49,840
Finally, it is clear that it wasn't me.

477
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,560
If a student tells me it was him, I have to believe him, don't I?

478
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:13,760
-Hello. -What a surprise. Do you live here?

479
00:32:14,120 --> 00:32:15,440
There is a meeting for the PTA.

480
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:18,080
I heard a rumor about the Catalan exam.

481
00:32:18,520 --> 00:32:19,800
I came to support you.

482
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:22,440
It's been sorted out. There's no evidence against me.

483
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:24,120
-Really? -Are you surprised?

484
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:26,840
Yes. Bending the rules is your style.

485
00:32:27,040 --> 00:32:29,320
Although, this time, I thought you had gone too far.

486
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,240
With my daring style,

487
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:36,160
I want to say that I'm attracted to you.

488
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:39,400
Yes, I got nerve. I already know that.

489
00:32:39,480 --> 00:32:43,000
Yes, it is true. The word nerve fits you perfectly.

490
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,350
It's inappropriate. We are at school.

491
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:45,600
Am I the only one to think this way?

492
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:48,560
Any place is good for me to tell you I like you.

493
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,720
-Gina. -Hello.

494
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:53,960
-Are you going to the meeting? -Yes, I'm going. See you.

495
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,280
You know what? There's a

496
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,920
wide-spread tendency for hiding our thoughts.

497
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,800
Life would be simpler if we didn't try to complicate everything.

498
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,600
There are people, many people,

499
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,440
who like someone but they don't say it.

500
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,880
Why don't you admit that you like me, too?

501
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,080
No, I will not answer that question. Please!

502
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,840
The fact that we get along is one thing. But another thing...

503
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:25,120
How dare you? Let's pretend this never happened, okay?

504
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:33,960
Look.

505
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,280
I have seen this movie.

506
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:42,520
Yes, you have seen it many times. I'll put it on. Okay?

507
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,120
Okay, yes.

508
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,040
This town is getting colder and colder.

509
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:54,680
Hello.

510
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,800
-Why didn't you answer? -I didn't hear you.

511
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,960
Dad hasn't returned from Tarragona?

512
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:12,320
He called. He said that factory will pick him.

513
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,960
For three weeks, only. I don't know if it's worth going that far.

514
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,360
At least he is trying something.

515
00:34:18,370 --> 00:34:20,600
I'm hungry. Is there anything to eat?

516
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,400
Make yourself a steak.

517
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,600
Do you think it's funny the fridge is empty?

518
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:31,040
If you know it's empty, then, why did you ask?

519
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,040
-Why didn't you go shopping? -With what money?

520
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,000
Work and the fridge will be full.

521
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:38,000
-You're so annoying. -I'm the only one who brings money home.

522
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:40,520
-I've killed myself working... -Working with what?

523
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:45,840
You're like dad when he had a job. Do you want to be the hero?

524
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,120
Dad gets unemployment payments and mom's pension.

525
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:51,720
He earns shit from both, Pol! Stop studying.

526
00:34:52,240 --> 00:34:53,880
You never pass anything.

527
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:55,370
Hey! Rosaura said that there

528
00:34:55,370 --> 00:34:57,600
won't be slaughter in the village this year.

529
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,320
Okay. I'll call Rosaura, granny.

530
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,000
Let's watch a movie, granny.

531
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,640
-Hello. -Hello.

532
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:31,360
Listen, Bruno, I appreciate what you did today.

533
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,480
What did I do?

534
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,720
You told Toni that you had stolen the exam.

535
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,080
-Wasn't it you? -No.

536
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:48,080
Grandma wanted me to save you, but...

537
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,600
I wouldn't confess to something I didn't do.

538
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,960
So, who was it?

539
00:35:58,920 --> 00:36:03,240
You stole the Catalan exam? I don't believe it.

540
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:06,480
You don't need to do that. You have excellent grades.

541
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:10,080
Mom, I didn't do well in the first exam. I got a six.

542
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,560
Son, but what have you done? I don't believe you stole an exam!

543
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,120
-The staffroom was empty. -Someone forced you.

544
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:18,200
No.

545
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:20,880
That couldn't have been your idea. Who are your friends?

546
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,760
The same you know. This has nothing to do with anyone.

547
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:30,760
I was tired of studying so much and...

548
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:34,520
-I won't do it again. -Don't tell dad.

549
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:38,520
He will know, anyway.

550
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,120
Toni will call you. I have to stay home for three days.

551
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,600
Go get your father. It's dinner time.

552
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,680
-Dad. -Yes.

553
00:36:59,800 --> 00:37:02,280
-It's dinner time. Are you coming?

554
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,840
-Of course. But come here a minute.

555
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:11,440
Do you see how beautiful it is? It will be the best model of all.

556
00:37:12,760 --> 00:37:15,880
Look at the mainmast. It gives balance to the sails.

557
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:20,600
And the distance from bow to stern. It was all thought with care.

558
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,960
No piece is missing.

559
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:29,000
It is perfect. I'll finish it in five days.

560
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:33,480
Go to the dining room. I'm coming.

561
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,440
No.

562
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,680
I have a Philosophy exam next week.

563
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,320
-Do you need help to study? -Why?

564
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,840
Don't I help with your homework sometimes?

565
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,160
I'll buy the clothes I like with my money.

566
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,520
All right, sounds good.

567
00:38:04,480 --> 00:38:07,440
-You are not against it anymore? -I only ask you to be careful.

568
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:16,920
She doesn't like the shirt. She likes you in the shirt.

569
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,880
-Again, what do you know? -I know.

570
00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:22,200
-I don't believe it. -Stop thinking she doesn't like you.

571
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,990
I'm not the only one who likes her.

572
00:38:24,990 --> 00:38:27,320
I know that there's someone else.

573
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:34,480
Just like that? I like you? People don't say that.

574
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:37,400
Women like when men say those things.

575
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:40,120
Even more if that's the man we like.

576
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,440
Yes, two afternoons are enough for me. I'll let you know.

577
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:47,600
Good bye.

578
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:53,120
Moron. Tomorrow, I'll have to go to the office earlier.

579
00:38:55,120 --> 00:38:57,760
What a good smell. Do you know how much you scored in Catalan?

580
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:03,920
-Not yet. -Will you have the Philosophy exam soon?

581
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,120
It's different.

582
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:12,040
Just like him, a different teacher.

583
00:39:12,200 --> 00:39:14,600
That doesn't mean he's better than others.

584
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:17,230
Believe me. I have experience.

585
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,480
You haven't seen him in a long time.

586
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:24,200
Yes. His son studies law. And in the afternoons,

587
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:27,320
-he works with his father. He's 22. -Dear me.

588
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:30,240
You'll have the same privilege. Before finishing university,

589
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:32,440
-you will help me at the office. -What if I don't get in?

590
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,580
With your grades, sure you'll get in.

591
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:35,800
The minimum grade isn't high.

592
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:39,960
-For Hispanic Philology is lower. -Again with the Philology.

593
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,240
What's wrong? Don't you want to be lawyer?

594
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:43,840
You told me you like studying laws.

595
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,040
Jaume, let him be. He's just in first year.

596
00:39:46,120 --> 00:39:47,720
At his age, I already knew what I wanted to be.

597
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:50,720
And my father was not a lawyer. I had to build my own career.

598
00:39:51,120 --> 00:39:52,560
I have stomachache. I'm going to bed.

599
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,320
-What are you saying? What's wrong? -Let him be. Let him rest.

600
00:39:57,240 --> 00:39:58,640
Jaume...

601
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,000
If I tell you something, promise me you will be understanding?

602
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,550
Whoever was the student who saved you,

603
00:40:06,550 --> 00:40:08,760
you'll have to look after him.

604
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:13,880
He sacrificed for you. You are a mythological hero.

605
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:17,880
These heroes don't exist anymore.

606
00:40:37,760 --> 00:40:39,080
Joan...

607
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,560
Erase picture cancel

608
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,680
Do you know my father was a jerk to me?

609
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:11,320
It wasn't easy to get where I am now.

610
00:41:13,200 --> 00:41:14,760
I don't want to be a jerk to you, Joan.

611
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,600
But I'll do whatever is necessary so you won't go astray.

612
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:20,240
In a few years, when you become a lawyer, you'll thank me.

613
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,400
All teenagers share the same story.

614
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,560
You complain about everything, but when you get older

615
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,360
you end up thanking us.

616
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:35,360
I respect what you've done.

617
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,800
Forget about hanging out with your friends. Is that clear?

618
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:18,750
For more than 2000 years,

619
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:21,040
the power tells us what to do and think.

620
00:42:21,400 --> 00:42:23,840
They want us submissive and silent.

621
00:42:23,920 --> 00:42:25,680
Well, go to hell.

622
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:31,760
What if your gesture is useless, Joan?

623
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,360
You sacrificed yourself for me. Is it worth it?

624
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,160
Is it right that a teacher become friends with his students?

625
00:42:38,680 --> 00:42:41,520
No, we are not friends. He teaches and that's it.

626
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:45,320
Gerard, you deserve a three, but I gave you a four.

627
00:42:46,720 --> 00:42:48,280
I think you mark according to the student.

628
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,520
Are you telling me that the grade I gave

629
00:42:50,600 --> 00:42:52,120
to Gerard has something to do

630
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,240
-with me hooking up with his mother? -Yes.

631
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:56,460
-Man, I love how you recite Shakespeare.

632
00:42:56,460 --> 00:42:58,240
-Yes, I know a lot of monologues.

633
00:42:58,320 --> 00:42:59,760
-Someday you can recite me one.

634
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:01,360
-I would love to have an audience.

635
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,480
Romeo, Juliet. Really, whatever.

636
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:09,080
Please, leave now.

637
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:10,920
So, will we have dinner or not?

638
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:13,640
No.

639
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,600
Don't tell me anything. I don't want to know anything.

640
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:17,120
Only ten steps.

641
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,200
What did you do? You took him out without my permission.

642
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:20,880
Don't ever come back to my house.

643
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:23,040
You question the values learnt at home.

644
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:24,240
And that's indoctrination.

645
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:26,480
I just want the students to think freely.

646
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,040
That freedom led him to the staffroom

647
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:33,720
-to steal an exam. -I just wonder why you have to crush him.

648
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,840
You crush him with your brainwashing. Understand?
