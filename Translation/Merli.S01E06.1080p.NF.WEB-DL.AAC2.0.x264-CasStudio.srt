1
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:14,680
Silence! Can you be quiet?

2
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,200
This assignment will count as a test

3
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:19,040
for the three who were suspended.

4
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:21,680
For the rest of you, it'll help your grades.

5
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,360
You can do it with a partner.

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:29,160
You must answer the following question with solid arguments:

7
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,600
If Aristotle were alive, would he have a Facebook profile?

8
00:00:35,960 --> 00:00:38,040
Suspended students hand in the assignment tomorrow.

9
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,120
-The others can have three days. -That's not enough time.

10
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,720
Yes, it is. Silence! Attention, disciples.

11
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,760
I want to introduce a very special friend.

12
00:00:56,560 --> 00:00:59,720
I'll flunk whoever writes his name wrong on the exam.

13
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,360
According to Schopenhauer,

14
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,360
man is a disgusting creature.

15
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,920
A man's desire of immortality is the desire of perpetuation

16
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,160
of a big mistake.

17
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:10,960
Sit up straight.

18
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,320
How can man be corrupt, a torturer and a murderer,

19
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:19,160
-can organize wars and genocides?

20
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:21,080
-The world is full of motherfuckers.

21
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,040
Yes, and why are we motherfuckers?

22
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,080
I have no idea.

23
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:30,360
Because our intelligence gives us the ability to harm.

24
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:33,440
According to Schopenhauer,

25
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,880
animals are not cruel to one another. But man is,

26
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:40,040
because you must be smart to harm others.

27
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,120
He said that all there is in the world are desires.

28
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,960
For example, we desire to have someone or something.

29
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,792
And, once we get tired of it,

30
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:52,720
we want something else. Why is that?

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,880
Where does that lead us,

32
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:03,880
when our desires are never satisfied?

33
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:05,480
Does anyone know?

34
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,960
-To frustration. -Go a little further.

35
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:14,440
-Suffering. -Exactly. Suffering.

36
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,800
Schopenhauer considered that life is essentially suffering.

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,440
Very nice, right?

38
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,600
Imagine going to a party with that idiot.

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,280
Schopenhauer.

40
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:28,440
And what do you want, disgusting creatures?

41
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,440
-I want a motorcycle. -Yeah.

42
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:34,052
-And you, Berta, what do you want?

43
00:02:34,053 --> 00:02:36,360
-That you stop being my teacher.

44
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:41,760
You spend the whole class drawing on your table.

45
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,320
So what?

46
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,800
Taking notes on the table is so dirty.

47
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,198
I don't know. It's like

48
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:50,440
fucking your partner with a cat in the bed.

49
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,480
You can't leave in the middle of class.

50
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,960
I'll be right back.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:15,280
He is watching you.

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
Laia, here you are. Have you seen Berta Prats?

53
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,160
No, no. Listen!

54
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,840
I called you yesterday, but you didn't answer.

55
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,000
Yeah, I couldn't reach the phone.

56
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,308
No, it's okay. I know

57
00:04:15,309 --> 00:04:17,800
that you and I have no special relationship.

58
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:21,560
But sometimes I would like to do something different.

59
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:23,320
-Different? -Yes.

60
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,840
Can we talk later? I must go back, I left the students alone.

61
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,440
-Alone? -Yes.

62
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,600
Where is that girl?

63
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:44,160
Berta! Are you okay?

64
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:45,320
Yes, yes.

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,840
What are you doing out here?

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,080
Let's go inside.

67
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:56,760
Throw that away.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,600
Come on.

69
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:02,200
But are you aware of what might have happened?

70
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,160
How could I know she would escape?

71
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:11,280
Toni, we are all little nervous.

72
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,080
Why don't you let me talk to her for a minute?

73
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,720
As you like.

74
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,720
I want this cleared up. Okay?

75
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,920
Let's see, Berta.

76
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,600
It's okay. I like you.

77
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:29,400
Give me a break.

78
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,240
I don't care whether you like me as a teacher or not.

79
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:35,800
But lately, I see that you are suffering.

80
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,680
Are you a psychologist now?

81
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,057
If you have a problem,

82
00:05:40,058 --> 00:05:42,520
I think it'd be good if you talked to someone.

83
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,000
I don't know how Bruno can stand you.

84
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,720
The first day, I thought you were tough.

85
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,000
How old are you?

86
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:56,320
Why are you acting like a friend?

87
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:59,280
Do you want to fuck a student?

88
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,480
Do you think I want to fuck girls at your age?

89
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:04,720
Fresh meat.

90
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:08,680
I told you what I wanted to tell you.

91
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:11,680
-I just hope that you... -Fuck off!

92
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:18,800
Well, I can do the section one.

93
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,800
-You can do section two. -Hello.

94
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:26,200
If you prefer section one, I'll do the section two.

95
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:28,120
I also agree.

96
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,400
Does she like me? It's a pain. I haven't read it yet.

97
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,080
Don't tell her.

98
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,160
-No? -No.

99
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,680
Of course not, man.

100
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:43,520
What the fuck! I went out to the street, and Eugeni caught me.

101
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,280
She saw you with Marc, the other day.

102
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,920
Yes.

103
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:04,960
-Yeah? -Yeah.

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,600
-The protagonist is very authentic. -Very authentic.

105
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,600
And funny sometimes.

106
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,680
He is not funny.

107
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,280
Funny... What is funny, after all? But...

108
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,760
How about you and I pair up for the Philosophy assignment?

109
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,680
Unless you don't want to...

110
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:27,240
Yes, I do.

111
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,360
I'm free tomorrow afternoon, and there'll be no one home.

112
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:31,800
Good.

113
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:35,640
-I'll send you the address via WhatsApp. -Good. Good.

114
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,920
What should I have done?

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:44,040
-Tie Berta to a chair? -Do what we all do.

116
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,640
Notify the teacher on duty.

117
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:47,560
-Exactly. -He did tell me that.

118
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:49,000
You were not on duty.

119
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:51,160
I never imagined she would go out on the street.

120
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,200
You have no idea what they can do.

121
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,280
Responsibility is everything.

122
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,480
Something could have happened, Santi.

123
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,480
We'll open a disciplinary file for Berta.

124
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,800
Only for Berta?

125
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,240
I won't let this turn into a fight between two teachers.

126
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,640
At least she will pay for what she did.

127
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,480
You take it as a personal triumph.

128
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:29,000
Come on. You two, stop.

129
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,600
Toni, do you think this is enough?

130
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:33,240
That the problem is solved?

131
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:36,000
What matters the most is knowing what happens to that girl.

132
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:38,093
You worry so much about the students,

133
00:08:38,094 --> 00:08:40,120
but you let them run away from school.

134
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:50,000
Thank you. Bye.

135
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,960
She made a fuss over nothing.

136
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:53,920
-Now Berta has an issue on her file. -What do you say?

137
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,080
-Fuck. -I swear.

138
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,640
I don't give a damn.

139
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,280
Don't overdo it. She is in a bad state.

140
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,360
Let's tell her to come. I feel bad.

141
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,000
Marc, if she comes, I'm leaving.

142
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Yes, let's go.

143
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,240
I have to pick up my brother at school.

144
00:09:19,691 --> 00:09:21,120
and Santi gave us homework.

145
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,880
Your parents control you a lot, huh?

146
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:27,640
Come on, catch him!

147
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:34,040
Hi.

148
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,600
You must have had a good day. You are happy.

149
00:09:40,680 --> 00:09:41,680
Yes.

150
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,880
Did you have Philosophy today?

151
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,920
-Scho... -Schopenhauer?

152
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,160
That's him! He has a creepy face.

153
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,680
-Seriously? -Yes.

154
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,520
No wonder he is dating the English teacher.

155
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,640
What?

156
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,360
Yeah, he's dating Laia. Pol said so.

157
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,120
And is she good looking?

158
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,320
Yes, very beautiful.

159
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:08,200
Besides, she is very young. She could be his daughter.

160
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,000
She must be about 25 years old.

161
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,200
You can. But I don't need to know those things.

162
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Okay.

163
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:22,840
There goes the girl.

164
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,611
She gets up from her chair,

165
00:10:24,612 --> 00:10:26,880
walks across the room, leaves the class,

166
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:29,920
walks out of the school and almost gets herself killed.

167
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,240
-Does Berta get along with you? -Not really.

168
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,120
What kind of relationship do you have with Bruno?

169
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,000
Shut up!

170
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:45,680
Today, we learned about Schopenhauer.

171
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,520
He says humans are like porcupines.

172
00:10:51,960 --> 00:10:54,520
When it's cold, they gather to get warm.

173
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,240
But if they get too close, they are pricked.

174
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:01,000
Then, they have to keep a certain distance. Understand?

175
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,600
You're there in the corner, alone, in the cold...

176
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:12,080
I'll tell Bruno to come see you.

177
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,000
I said no!

178
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,840
Let's walk a little more. Get up. Just a little more.

179
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:21,440
Get up and look up.

180
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:25,800
So we can badmouth the people passing by.

181
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,000
Can we go home? I feel bad.

182
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:29,680
Okay, let's go.

183
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,920
But I'll tell Bruno to come and see you tomorrow.

184
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,600
So, go have breakfast together.

185
00:11:48,080 --> 00:11:50,920
He enjoys it. You can talk about politics. He likes that.

186
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:53,240
Why do I have to go exactly?

187
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:56,280
Honestly, I thought you'd like to see him.

188
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:04,160
He's a freak. That's why you get along with him.

189
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,840
Am I a freak?

190
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:08,080
Just look at the question you've put on the exam.

191
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,840
And the poster.

192
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:11,720
Shameful.

193
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,960
Go see him tomorrow and stop talking.

194
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:20,120
-How much will you pay me? -Zero.

195
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,800
You charge to be there. Why can't I?

196
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:23,640
You shouldn't do it for money.

197
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,600
You pay, I'll go. Let's say, ten euros?

198
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Ten euros.

199
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,840
Jeez, going for money is ugly.

200
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,640
Who did I learn that from?

201
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:41,680
Hi.

202
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:42,880
Come in.

203
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,360
Gerard is not coming?

204
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
No, he'll come later. Over here.

205
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,040
Well, what happened?

206
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:55,080
What happened? Are you dating the English teacher?

207
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:57,840
No, it's not exactly like that.

208
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,720
What if I were? Yes, I'm not going to cheat on you.

209
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:03,840
We fucked, but it is over. But she still doesn't know that.

210
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,080
What a coward!

211
00:13:06,760 --> 00:13:08,600
Now I see that you have two faces.

212
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,752
You are sniffing like a dog,

213
00:13:09,753 --> 00:13:11,360
and you were sniffing the English teacher.

214
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:12,520
Damn, Gina.

215
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,808
With Laia, it was only sex.

216
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:15,600
You and I have a different relationship.

217
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,080
I've been already screwed up once.

218
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,080
My ex cheated on me for a long time with another woman.

219
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,080
I will break up with Laia like I planned to do.

220
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,120
Seriously, we haven't seen each other for days.

221
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,600
I'll tell her it's over.

222
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,400
-Hello! -Hey!

223
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,080
Goodness, what are you doing here?

224
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,840
Listen, Gerard, you'll be the first one to know.

225
00:13:41,960 --> 00:13:43,240
Your mother and I...

226
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,240
we are organizing a trip to CosmoCaixa.

227
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,800
Yes, we are.

228
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:49,880
Cool.

229
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:52,760
But what does that have to do with Philosophy?

230
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,480
Galileo, Giordano Bruno...

231
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:57,880
I have been looking for the information of the museum...

232
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,760
do you know where the triptychs are?

233
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:03,520
When you find them, give it to Gerard and he'll give them to me.

234
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,680
We still have time to travel this semester.

235
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,680
-Sorry for making you come here for this. -It's okay.

236
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,200
You mother said that you used to go to a private school.

237
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,783
They'd go camping, do field trips,

238
00:14:15,784 --> 00:14:17,160
travel at the end of the year...

239
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,120
More than anything to justify the price.

240
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,440
Goodbye, see you later.

241
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,680
The house is beautiful.

242
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,320
Sometimes he pisses me off. He has a way of seeing things...

243
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,400
I don't know. He is radical.

244
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,240
He is radical,

245
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,480
weird, selfish, self-seeking...

246
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,920
The teachers can't stand him. Eugeni wants to kill him.

247
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:22,920
You know?

248
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:26,000
You think he help you because he cares?

249
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,840
He does it for the money.

250
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,520
-I mean, not just for the money... -No, don't try to fix it.

251
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,920
Is it true that you like politics?

252
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,040
Politicians always say the same.

253
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,360
And what do they say?

254
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:48,560
If you don't know, why do you say they say?

255
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,640
If they cut off the head of those who steal,

256
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
the others would have to think twice.

257
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,640
There's new girl in class, right?

258
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,520
Gerard is head over heels.

259
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:10,440
You would agree, she is a bombshell.

260
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,800
Do you like her?

261
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:14,520
Yes.

262
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,920
Why are you so quiet?

263
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:24,000
You asked me: "Do you like her?"

264
00:17:25,580 --> 00:17:26,840
-I don't know man. Yes, you can.

265
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,280
I'm shocked.

266
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,800
-If you're not, then fine. -Of course I'm not.

267
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,960
-Okay, no problem. You like girls.

268
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,560
I didn't say that to laugh at you.

269
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,080
It's okay.

270
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:43,440
If you keep making stupid remarks, don't come back to school.

271
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:53,960
-Hello. -Hello.

272
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,120
Hi.

273
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,600
Hi.

274
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:09,480
-What is that? -Tea.

275
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:14,840
Listen, Laia.

276
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,880
I was thinking about what you told me.

277
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:24,520
I didn't answer a few calls because...

278
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,520
How can I put this?

279
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,560
I think I can't catch up with you anymore.

280
00:18:31,720 --> 00:18:33,680
What do you mean by that?

281
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,080
I mean...

282
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,120
Let's see.

283
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:42,000
I don't think I'm the type that you should fall for.

284
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,280
Who told you that I am in love with you?

285
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,760
Yeah, but just in case...

286
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,080
Ah, just in case.

287
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,320
Yes, well...

288
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:51,400
Look.

289
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,080
I think you need someone who you can make plans with.

290
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,360
Someone who can give you children.

291
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,920
And I just had a vasectomy.

292
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,720
And...

293
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,760
Anyway, I think it's great that we could keep seeing each other,

294
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,960
but I think you needed to know that.

295
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,880
Okay. So...

296
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,360
Thank you very much for the information.

297
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:22,240
Let me think about it and I'll let you know.

298
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:23,720
Yes, of course.

299
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:27,320
I'm leaving.

300
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,200
Hello, Berta.

301
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,920
What happened?

302
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,880
Nothing. I fell down a staircase.

303
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,400
Does it hurt?

304
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,680
Yes.

305
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,840
Berta, what's wrong? You're very strange.

306
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,440
It doesn't matter. Forget it.

307
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Come on, tell me.

308
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,480
-Promise me you won't tell anyone? -Sure.

309
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:01,114
My father got angry because

310
00:20:01,115 --> 00:20:03,960
he says I don't do anything and get bad grades.

311
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,200
He got very angry.

312
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:11,320
He took my hand and twisted it.

313
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,080
But how are you? I'm freaking out.

314
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,320
I hate when these things happen.

315
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,240
Didn't you tell your mother? Didn't you defend yourself?

316
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,920
Don't tell anyone. Okay?

317
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:35,760
You should tell.

318
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:39,000
He got angry and then apologized.

319
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,280
Okay.

320
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:46,520
He twisted her arm?

321
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,520
Yes. It seems like he got angry and started yelling

322
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,640
and ended up...

323
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:51,880
Son of a bitch.

324
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:53,480
Oh, my. Poor girl.

325
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,600
I feel sorry for her.

326
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,400
It's strange, because her father is always traveling.

327
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,080
-He had a fight with her mother. -Yes.

328
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,640
I know her father and I know he has a bad temper.

329
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,080
-But hurting her... -He hurt her a lot.

330
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:07,680
We should tell the teachers.

331
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,920
No. I think she is the one who must tell them.

332
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,680
We have to tell them. They could help her.

333
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,200
No, Joan. We have to wait.

334
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,600
Yes, it is better to wait for her to do tell them.

335
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:17,840
What's up?

336
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,360
Honestly, do you think people notice me?

337
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:22,680
No.

338
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,960
What a strain on yesterday's meeting.

339
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:30,280
-Sorry if you got nervous, but that... -No, no.

340
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:36,160
Besides, sometimes I admit that I annoy him.

341
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,840
No, no. But I understand you.

342
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:41,400
I mean, when necessary...

343
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:43,360
you must be firm. Right?

344
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,640
I am firm, but I'm also friendly, right?

345
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,480
Yes, very much.

346
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:50,200
-At least I think so. -Yes.

347
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,400
I mean...

348
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,600
In other words, you are firm but...

349
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,680
-Sensitive? -Yes.

350
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,120
Do you like a bar called Flagstaff?

351
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:07,120
-Is it a country music bar? -Yes.

352
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,520
-Do you like country music? -Yes, a lot.

353
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,600
Oh, yeah?

354
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:13,600
-What is wrong with country music? -It's just that...

355
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,240
If you want, I invite you. Shall we have a beer this afternoon?

356
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:21,720
Is that...

357
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,120
It's that...

358
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,920
-I have things to do. -Sure. Yes, yes.

359
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,200
-Yes, yes. -We can go another day?

360
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,880
-Yes. Very well. -Yes. Great.

361
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,000
One moment, please.

362
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:37,600
Remember you have a test next week.

363
00:22:37,680 --> 00:22:39,280
-Yes. -On what?

364
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,520
Bruno, I just said: lesson six and seven.

365
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,767
Man, today is my day.

366
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,600
You fuck her today.

367
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:56,160
What did I tell you?

368
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,320
-I don't know. But something will happen. -Come here.

369
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,960
You must be confident with her.

370
00:23:03,320 --> 00:23:04,360
Berta.

371
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,480
I heard what your father did.

372
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,695
-Shit, man. I told Marc not to tell...

373
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:12,480
-I think you should do something.

374
00:23:13,160 --> 00:23:14,640
I can't, I'm afraid.

375
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:16,920
I need some time.

376
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:19,200
As you wish.

377
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
See you tomorrow.

378
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:28,840
Berta.

379
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,400
Why did you tell her?

380
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:32,560
Damn, Berta. This is very serious.

381
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:34,840
I did it to help you.

382
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,240
Tania is a nice girl. She encouraged me.

383
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:40,840
So did I.

384
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,160
I know how these family problems are.

385
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:44,640
And I hate seeing you like this.

386
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,840
I am very lonely in the afternoon until my father comes home.

387
00:23:58,120 --> 00:24:00,120
How about your sister and your mother?

388
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,120
They always come home very late.

389
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,240
Well, then...

390
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,760
if you want, I could go one of these days

391
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,160
to keep you company.

392
00:24:17,444 --> 00:24:19,720
have to pick up my little brother at school.

393
00:24:26,560 --> 00:24:28,000
I know. It's complicated.

394
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,320
What a view!

395
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:36,440
Damn, how come you live so far from school?

396
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:38,196
When we moved, my parents

397
00:24:38,197 --> 00:24:41,080
split up and my mother stayed in the house.

398
00:24:41,720 --> 00:24:43,400
My parents are also divorced.

399
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,720
But I take the opportunity to get money from my father.

400
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:46,800
What are you talking about?

401
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,600
-Two hundred euros a month or so. -Two hundred euros?

402
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:53,960
-What? He is a doctor and has money. -My father is a doctor, too.

403
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,280
Really?

404
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,760
-You and I have things in common. -Let's do the assignment.

405
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:00,520
Right.

406
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,840
Berta...

407
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,160
are you sure you want this?

408
00:25:23,662 --> 00:25:26,080
want it to look like I'm taking advantage of you.

409
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,400
What's wrong, Marc? You're acting weird.

410
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:34,840
My father hit me a few times, too.

411
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:36,360
Oh, my.

412
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:38,513
Do you remember in eighth grade,

413
00:25:38,514 --> 00:25:40,240
when someone stole my video game?

414
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:42,440
-Yes, the small one. -The PSP.

415
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:46,280
My parents forbade me to take it to school,

416
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:47,680
but I ignored them.

417
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,120
And when it disappeared,

418
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,680
my father hit me a lot.

419
00:25:57,280 --> 00:25:58,440
I was 14.

420
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,040
Then, my mother left him.

421
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:08,280
I still don't know who stole my PSP.

422
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,320
There's always stealing in school.

423
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:19,440
-Do you still see him? -Sometimes.

424
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:23,200
He has a crazy business that always goes wrong.

425
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:25,320
He is a failure.

426
00:26:28,840 --> 00:26:30,520
You're always so happy.

427
00:26:30,760 --> 00:26:33,120
Berta, I'm fine.

428
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,520
People think that I am funny.

429
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,840
Yes, I am, but I am also sensitive.

430
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:47,920
We won't do anything.

431
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,200
I mean it.

432
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,480
No one should know about this. Let's not tell Tania.

433
00:27:03,160 --> 00:27:04,640
What about Tania?

434
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,520
Nothing.

435
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
Yes.

436
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:18,880
-Are you leaving now? -Yes, why?

437
00:27:19,040 --> 00:27:20,480
Nothing.

438
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,880
I thought about what you told me,

439
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:24,640
that you can't have children.

440
00:27:24,960 --> 00:27:26,176
I don't want to have kids.

441
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:28,000
So, I don't have any problem with that.

442
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,280
We can continue seeing each other.

443
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:35,240
And since you had a vasectomy, this shouldn't be a problem.

444
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,120
Instead of being a man and leaving me,

445
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,680
you made up this shit about not being able to have kids.

446
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,680
What for? So I would break up with you?

447
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:49,360
I might be a little naive, but I'm not an idiot.

448
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,080
-How did she take it? -Well.

449
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:57,600
I don't know where you and I are going.

450
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,800
We'll go wherever we want.

451
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:03,720
Do you think we can go to CosmoCaixa only for sex?

452
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:07,560
Yes. Gerard already knows about the trip to the museum.

453
00:28:07,960 --> 00:28:09,560
Then, we have to do it.

454
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:18,120
What is the dog doing here?

455
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,200
-No, get it away from here, Gina. -Why? This is Rufo.

456
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,720
No, it is just that...

457
00:28:28,040 --> 00:28:29,040
Come here.

458
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,720
-You do understand, right? -Yes, I understand.

459
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:44,200
-But I don't want to take him away. -Don't you see him every day?

460
00:28:44,280 --> 00:28:47,680
You rather make me uncomfortable than taking him away?

461
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:49,720
If you're so uncomfortable, leave!

462
00:28:50,040 --> 00:28:53,520
Very well. I'll leave you guys here, chatting about your stuff.

463
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,680
Bye.

464
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,560
We can read it again, to see if there is something missing.

465
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,880
Right, yes.

466
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:14,480
Thank you for introducing me to "The Steppenwolf".

467
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,520
What else do you like?

468
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,480
What else do I like...

469
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,960
To eat.

470
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,800
I like paella, too. See? You and I...

471
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,120
is that I like you.

472
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:44,360
I...

473
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,280
I like you a lot.

474
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:52,680
When I saw you going to class, the first day...

475
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,920
I thought...

476
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,360
What is that?

477
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,320
A bull?

478
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,000
Yes, that's my grandfather's, from when he was young.

479
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,680
Oh, your grandfather was a bullfighter?

480
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,920
Yes, he used to fight in his hometown, Andalusia.

481
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,080
But now he's old and the poor man can't do it anymore.

482
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:20,400
Poor man?

483
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,080
The bulls he killed are the miserable ones, right?

484
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:26,160
I like bullfighting festivals. Bullfighting is an art.

485
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:27,400
You're kidding.

486
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:28,800
No.

487
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,909
-You think torturing animals is an art.

488
00:30:30,910 --> 00:30:33,000
-Gerard, can we continue working, please?

489
00:30:33,120 --> 00:30:36,200
No. It's shocking that you're saying something like that.

490
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:37,440
I don't understand.

491
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:39,000
It's art, tradition, culture.

492
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:40,360
What you don't understand?

493
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:42,800
-How many bulls did he kill? -What is your point?

494
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,640
They take the bulls there and kill them as if it were a show.

495
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,000
Do you think it's normal?

496
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,200
You're not normal. Leave.

497
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:52,040
-What? -I don't want you talking to me like that.

498
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,520
So, you have to leave my house.

499
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:08,642
He doesn't want to leave the room.

500
00:31:08,643 --> 00:31:10,000
I don't know what is wrong with him.

501
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,560
He had a bad day.

502
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,640
Your son came over this morning. Do you think they argued?

503
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,200
Who knows what Bruno told him.

504
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:18,760
I have to go.

505
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,440
Go in peace.

506
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:22,480
Let me know if it gets tricky.

507
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,840
-Bye. -Bye.

508
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:43,440
What are you doing here?

509
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
What's that face? What's up?

510
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,200
-I told you not to ask Bruno to come. -Why? What did he say?

511
00:31:50,280 --> 00:31:52,760
What happened? Did he insult you?

512
00:31:52,920 --> 00:31:54,880
-Did he laugh at you? -No, he's not the problem.

513
00:31:57,320 --> 00:31:58,520
-I'm your teacher. -Are you?

514
00:31:58,600 --> 00:31:59,640
You do whatever you want.

515
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,080
You take advantage of me being sick and deceive me.

516
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,160
I'm sick, fucker. Don't you understand?

517
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,160
You're sick, but you don't want to see a shrink.

518
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,800
I do my best for you to have friends.

519
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,640
Why should I have friends when you don't have any?

520
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:16,520
You don't know how to interact with people.

521
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:20,640
You think you are too good and that others are shit.

522
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,040
Maybe other people don't need you.

523
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,675
The teachers at school can't stand you.

524
00:32:27,676 --> 00:32:29,160
Even your son criticizes you.

525
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,400
And I feel sorry for scoundrels!

526
00:32:46,741 --> 00:32:47,840
-No, I didn't tell him that you dance,

527
00:32:47,920 --> 00:32:49,960
and I am tired of this topic.

528
00:32:51,960 --> 00:32:54,080
When I finish school, we'll see about that. But not now.

529
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:56,520
That's not what frightens you.

530
00:32:57,160 --> 00:32:59,080
You have to take off your mask.

531
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,960
What scares you is not the fact that he knows you dance, but...

532
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:03,520
-You know what. -No, I...

533
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:05,680
Dancing is my thing.

534
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,840
You stick with the dance thing again? How hard can it be?

535
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,680
Why the fuck do you care about what people say?

536
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:11,880
You have to think that you're not the only one.

537
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:15,240
No worries, Bruno! The world is full of fags.

538
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:21,760
-Will you deny the evidence? -Dad, you are crazy!

539
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,840
You shouldn't give a shit about what they think of you.

540
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,080
If you like guys...

541
00:33:25,160 --> 00:33:27,440
Dad, I forbid you to talk about this with anyone in this town!

542
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,680
Listen to me, dammit. You shouldn't care...

543
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,400
Shut up, shut up. No, no, no!

544
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:34,600
Oh, my God!

545
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,880
What did you think? That I wouldn't know?

546
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,720
The school called me.

547
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,246
You know that they will

548
00:34:27,247 --> 00:34:29,800
open a file and suspend you for three days?

549
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:32,040
What were you thinking?

550
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:34,040
I will not appeal like the previous times.

551
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:35,520
This time, you take the responsibility.

552
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:40,120
I'm exhausted.

553
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,840
I spent the day at the salon and taking care of your sister,

554
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,520
taking her to the training, the competitions...

555
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,720
At least, Cristina gives me joy.

556
00:34:48,840 --> 00:34:52,000
She wins competitions and still gets good grades.

557
00:34:52,080 --> 00:34:54,600
But I come here and I see the big picture.

558
00:34:54,760 --> 00:34:56,360
Did you make your bed today? No.

559
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:57,840
I already knew before entering your room.

560
00:34:59,160 --> 00:35:00,840
I gave up on you.

561
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:03,160
You ran away from school!

562
00:35:03,240 --> 00:35:04,840
Don't you feel ashamed? I do.

563
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:06,640
I called the principal:

564
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:09,360
"Elsa, calm down. That's what they do at this age".

565
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:10,680
"Bullshit".

566
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,033
This is not an age thing.

567
00:35:12,034 --> 00:35:13,880
This is my daughter, giving me a hard time.

568
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:18,040
You only give us trouble. Always with that bitter face.

569
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,680
I'll make dinner.

570
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,237
If you want, we will

571
00:35:30,238 --> 00:35:32,440
continue going out every afternoon for a walk.

572
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,440
You're right.

573
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:38,720
I have no friends and I want you to have some.

574
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:41,040
I'm contradictory. What can I say?

575
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:44,160
Friendship is overrated.

576
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,160
You can call anyone a friend.

577
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,760
For me, being alone has a double advantage.

578
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,520
You can be yourself and don't have to put up with anyone.

579
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:56,640
But I guess you already know that, right?

580
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,840
That's why I brought you a gift.

581
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,520
Bye.

582
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:52,745
What is it, in Philosophy,

583
00:36:52,746 --> 00:36:55,000
when everything goes wrong and life is a piece of shit?

584
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:58,040
Adolescent recalcitrant egocentricity.

585
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,280
I like a girl who likes bullfighting.

586
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:07,400
Is this obsession with animals a family thing?

587
00:37:07,480 --> 00:37:09,360
I like animals a lot.

588
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:12,240
Why are you looking at me like that? My favorite animal are dogs.

589
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:13,440
Mine is a steak.

590
00:37:13,840 --> 00:37:15,520
If possible, with chips.

591
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:20,000
She likes bullfighting.

592
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:25,040
When you're in love, you accept each other's differences.

593
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,144
I even think that you will

594
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,240
She is pretty and mature.

595
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:36,080
Like a woman?

596
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:37,880
Yes, she's no longer a little girl.

597
00:37:37,960 --> 00:37:40,680
Her rhythm, her beat is more like a woman's.

598
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,880
She thinks like a woman.

599
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:43,880
-Hello. -Excuse me.

600
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,560
It's okay, Marc. Gerard is leaving.

601
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:50,200
After giving me an overdose of silliness.

602
00:37:50,920 --> 00:37:52,000
What's up, Vilaseca?

603
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,320
Will this end soon?

604
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:03,520
I know what your father did.

605
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:07,280
-It just happened once. -I'll talk to Toni.

606
00:38:07,560 --> 00:38:09,160
I'll will do what should be done in these cases.

607
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:15,080
The school supports you. I understand you're afraid.

608
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,400
I don't fucking care.

609
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,720
It's a lie. No one hurt me. I did it myself.

610
00:38:27,920 --> 00:38:29,200
You see how you are suffering?

611
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,080
You're a little girl who is trying to get attention.

612
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:39,560
Someone hurt you and you keep silent.

613
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:47,760
Who is hurting you, Berta?

614
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,920
Don't tell this to anyone, please.

615
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:11,400
Open the book to page 32.

616
00:39:14,080 --> 00:39:15,960
Gerard, read it, please.

617
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:22,560
"The pastoral novel is one of the fundamental kinds

618
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:25,400
of prose of the Renaissance fiction in Spain.

619
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:28,720
Girl, my father knows.

620
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,558
It is characterized for its

621
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:30,880
idealizing content and neo-platonic aesthetics,

622
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:32,560
It tells us the amorous misadventures

623
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,360
We talk later. You'll go nuts.

624
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,320
of educated and idealized shepherds in an idyllic nature."

625
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,840
Stop.

626
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:41,680
Tania.

627
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,920
-Give me the phone, please. -I...

628
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:46,440
-You know that's not allowed in class. -Damn, Santi!

629
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:47,760
What's wrong with you?

630
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:50,320
She already put it away. You don't need to take it from her.

631
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,600
Really?

632
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:56,760
Rules are rules, Tania. Come on.

633
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,160
Keep going.

634
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:21,360
"The main characters tell their love... "

635
00:40:26,080 --> 00:40:27,720
Come on.

636
00:40:30,800 --> 00:40:33,080
You have the keys to the school, right?

637
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,360
I love dogs and you hate them.

638
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,920
I'm considerate and I want to make things easy.

639
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,480
Next time, I'll lock the dog in a room.

640
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:46,440
Well, I'll lock my mother in the bathroom.

641
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:48,640
And what do we do with our children?

642
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:49,920
Our children?

643
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:55,440
Our children are in class right now.

644
00:40:56,080 --> 00:40:58,320
And this room is empty.

645
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:00,640
No, not here.

646
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:08,400
-You're crazy, I said no. -Yes, I'm crazy and I turn you on.

647
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,560
I locked the door.

648
00:41:10,760 --> 00:41:13,560
-Oh, my! How old are we? -Seventeen.

649
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,520
We should be in Literature class, but we left. Nobody saw us.

650
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:21,880
We hid from the janitor and the director, running down the hall.

651
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:26,040
We never have time alone.

652
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,960
We saw this empty office and we shut ourselves inside.

653
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:33,600
We are seventeen and we are alone, at last.

654
00:41:44,600 --> 00:41:46,400
Okay, I went too far, right?

655
00:41:46,480 --> 00:41:47,947
But it was nice to be with you.

656
00:41:47,948 --> 00:41:49,840
And I get along with you. You know that.

657
00:41:49,960 --> 00:41:53,840
We may not agree in this case, but we do in others.

658
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:00,360
Can we forget about that and keep doing the assignment?

659
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:01,520
Please? For real.

660
00:42:04,040 --> 00:42:05,040
All right.

661
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:07,120
-But with two conditions. -Yes.

662
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:09,920
We do it at school and never talk about bulls again.

663
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:11,200
Not a word, okay.

664
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,920
There is something I would like to tell you.

665
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:19,400
I have what?

666
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:22,432
The way you talk, you know?

667
00:42:22,433 --> 00:42:24,560
Girls in class are more like children.

668
00:42:29,600 --> 00:42:30,600
Right.

669
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:39,840
For Schopenhauer, the only way to fight the desire

670
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:41,360
was to opt for nothing.

671
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:44,840
Nothingness is empty, the absence of desire.

672
00:42:45,560 --> 00:42:50,040
For him, it was the only way to fight suffering. Understand?

673
00:42:50,240 --> 00:42:52,360
He believed that to achieve complete happiness,

674
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,000
one should renounce every kind of desire.

675
00:42:58,320 --> 00:43:00,520
Come in. Hello, Berta.

676
00:43:00,600 --> 00:43:01,840
I was in the bathroom.

677
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,200
Come in.

678
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,520
How's your arm?

679
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,280
All right.

680
00:43:15,560 --> 00:43:18,440
Take off your jacket, you'll be more comfortable.

681
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:22,600
As I was saying,

682
00:43:23,800 --> 00:43:26,320
Schopenhauer thought that to avoid suffering

683
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:29,840
you had to give up desires, But how can we do that?

684
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,440
We always desire something.

685
00:43:32,360 --> 00:43:33,860
Dear bipeds, you must try

686
00:43:33,861 --> 00:43:36,680
to not be infected by Schopenhauer's pessimism.

687
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,556
But I threw a question

688
00:43:38,557 --> 00:43:41,600
in the air: whenever we get what we desire,

689
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:43,960
why do we desire something else?

690
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:52,000
Schopenhauer said that it was the only way out of suffering.

691
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:56,520
But if you have no desires, you still suffer, right?

692
00:43:56,600 --> 00:43:58,000
You might feel isolated.

693
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:01,680
You see everyone smiling and knowing what they want.

694
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,760
What if you don't know what you want?

695
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,000
What if...

696
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:10,640
you wake up and don't want to get out of bed?

697
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:12,640
That happens to some people.

698
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,280
Then what?

699
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,440
For those who feel that way,

700
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:18,674
it would do well for them

701
00:44:18,675 --> 00:44:21,200
to reconnect with the peripatetics' teacher,

702
00:44:22,120 --> 00:44:23,120
Aristotle.

703
00:44:24,200 --> 00:44:27,760
He said that hope is a waking dream.

704
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:38,160
Is it normal for Bruno to use the phone during the class?

705
00:44:38,320 --> 00:44:39,640
You're funny, aren't you?

706
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,880
-I'm not laughing. -Fuck it.

707
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:43,760
Go see the teacher on duty.

708
00:44:45,720 --> 00:44:47,280
This was broken on purpose.

709
00:44:47,360 --> 00:44:50,720
Listen, Joan, do you know anything about dad's model?

710
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,080
-What have you got here? -A piercing.

711
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:56,988
-He has nothing to do with it.

712
00:44:56,989 --> 00:44:58,680
-A teacher, friends with the students...

713
00:44:58,760 --> 00:45:00,360
I wanted to do this! Nobody told me to!

714
00:45:00,440 --> 00:45:02,280
At least he understands more than you!

715
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:06,280
How did you come up with the idea of the CosmoCaixa getaway?

716
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:07,800
-It was her. -It was him.

717
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:09,400
You have a boyfriend.

718
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,640
No.

719
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,880
Mom, don't lie to me. I know you do.

720
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:17,600
since I screwed up with his father.

721
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:22,200
I'm not selling the bike. So leave me alone.

722
00:45:22,280 --> 00:45:23,360
I kill myself working...

723
00:45:23,480 --> 00:45:25,880
Will you start with that, again?

724
00:45:26,760 --> 00:45:28,040
They cut the electricity.

725
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:32,280
You are in love.

726
00:45:32,360 --> 00:45:34,960
You don't need to tell me anything, but you're in love.

727
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:36,320
When you said:

728
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:42,640
I know it's very easy to tell you to forget that person.

729
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,654
But if the person ignores you,

730
00:45:44,655 --> 00:45:46,160
then it's the best thing you can do.
