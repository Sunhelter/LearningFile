1
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:19,480
Mireia, this week you made many photocopies.

2
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,600
Sorry.

3
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,240
It's okay. I only say this for you to keep it in mind.

4
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:33,040
Today, those suspended will come back.

5
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:37,520
-They will soon have the Philosophy test. -Good.

6
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,200
Today, your savior is back.

7
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,520
My savior? What are you talking about?

8
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,240
You pretend not to understand.

9
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,720
What's wrong, Eugeni? You haven't taken your pill today?

10
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:56,440
You earn the kids' trust. Then they stand up for you.

11
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:59,280
It's logical to remember that you are quite popular.

12
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:04,200
No, you're more well-known. The students call you Hitler.

13
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:44,520
You have done a shitty test. A disaster.

14
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,120
No, my students,

15
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,560
you don't deserve to be called "Peripatetics."

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,640
Socrates

17
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
Berta, F.

18
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:53,360
Tania, you have a D. Pity.

19
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,840
Marc, C. Barely.

20
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:58,960
Come in.

21
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
-C? -Come in.

22
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,760
You three, remember you will take a test on Thursday.

23
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,560
Monica, B.

24
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,840
-Good. -Great.

25
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:18,720
Gerard, you deserve a D, but I put down a D plus.

26
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:20,720
-D? It is impossible. -Sit down.

27
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,920
Don't ever write down again that Aristotle is Plato's father.

28
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:26,400
-Man... -You said it.

29
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,760
No. I said he was his disciple, not his father.

30
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:31,800
You didn't fail for that. The concepts are not well explained.

31
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,160
Oh Lord!

32
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,066
The philosopher that I present

33
00:02:37,067 --> 00:02:39,680
to you now is one of the greats. Socrates.

34
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,200
With this, you'll have a hard on.

35
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,440
-Good morning, Jaume. -Hey, what's up?

36
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:55,560
-Sit down. -Thank you.

37
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:56,920
You're welcome.

38
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,080
What's up? How is Joan?

39
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,542
He's repent. I still don't

40
00:03:03,543 --> 00:03:05,680
understand why he decided to steal the test.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,400
I wanted to talk to you and I want you to know that, to me,

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,280
Joan is still one of the best students we've had.

43
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,760
I won't consider that he took one copy of the test.

44
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
Thank you.

45
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,520
I hope this ends up as an anecdote.

46
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,880
I appreciate that you only suspended him for three days.

47
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,480
We, teachers, considered his academic record.

48
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,520
We decided the punishment for him and his friends.

49
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,280
Friends, friends. His friends are bad influence.

50
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,880
I don't think the bad influence is them, exactly.

51
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,720
It's not? Then who?

52
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,280
I don't know. At this age, they are all rebels.

53
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:41,440
It's harder for them to get used to changes.

54
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,240
What kind of change?

55
00:03:43,520 --> 00:03:45,240
No, everything here is the same.

56
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,800
Just that there's a new Philosophy teacher. Merli.

57
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:51,290
Merli. Yes. Joan talks a lot about him.

58
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:52,920
He is Bruno's father, isn't he?

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,480
Yes. He teaches differently. He befriends the students.

60
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,960
He doesn't limit himself to be just a teacher.

61
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,760
And he is able to guide them to following his thinking.

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,480
-It's just an opinion. -I don't like it.

63
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,600
-This means he puts ideas in their heads. -The kids love it.

64
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,160
It makes the class enjoyable. He makes them think.

65
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,920
That's good, Jaume.

66
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,000
But I think the ethical issue needs discussion.

67
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:22,320
I hope he doesn't indoctrinate them.

68
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,240
Do you think that it's right for parents to make you think

69
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:29,000
what's best for you?

70
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,320
Do not let anyone impose their way of thinking on you!

71
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,920
You are old enough to think for yourselves.

72
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,760
Bruno, this applies to you, too.

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,211
Merli, when you say don't

74
00:04:40,212 --> 00:04:42,440
let anyone impose their way of thinking on us,

75
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,000
you're imposing your thinking on us.

76
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,160
No, excuse me, I'm asking you to think for yourselves.

77
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,760
What if I don't want to think?

78
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:52,480
-Do I have to do that? -Then, no.

79
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,560
No, it's okay.

80
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:55,640
You're not obliged to think if you don't want to. It's okay.

81
00:04:55,760 --> 00:04:57,080
-Okay. -Very good.

82
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,807
Socrates was sentenced to death,

83
00:04:59,808 --> 00:05:02,200
accused of corrupting the young ones

84
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,360
and doubting their gods' existence.

85
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,760
When the only thing he did

86
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,640
was questioning the ideas they wanted to fill his head with.

87
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:12,000
More than 2,000 years ago,

88
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,440
that "Power" Tells us what we must do and think.

89
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:19,120
They want us submissive and silent. They can go to hell.

90
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,920
You did all of this? Have you learned how to cook?

91
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,600
My mother made them.

92
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:56,611
Today, I saw that you're very

93
00:05:56,612 --> 00:05:59,360
attentive and interested in Socrates lesson.

94
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:05,440
Do you know that he had a chance to take back his words

95
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:07,560
to save himself from being sentenced to death?

96
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,520
He didn't do it.

97
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,640
He followed them to the end.

98
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:20,080
He drank a glass of hemlock poison.

99
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,520
That gesture made him go down in history.

100
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,000
What if your gesture is useless, Joan?

101
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:37,840
Is your sacrifice for me worth it?

102
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:45,160
It's just that, I didn't do it for you.

103
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,600
I did it for myself.

104
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,120
Very well.

105
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,760
And when Marc saw that I got a D,

106
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,600
he looked at me with a sad face.

107
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,480
I wanted to eat him.

108
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,080
I was thinking, "Come comfort me, man.

109
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,120
Come comfort me and we can freak out together."

110
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:09,480
I didn't know you liked Marc that much.

111
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,680
-No, I don't like him. -Really?

112
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,200
-It's okay if you don't want to talk. -I like him a bit.

113
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,040
-But don't say anything. -No, I won't.

114
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:24,440
-I like him since the beginning of course. -Really?

115
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,240
On the first day, I thought,

116
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,960
"I would fuck him."

117
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,600
Girl, if he likes you, then it would be easy.

118
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,920
-Because he comes on really strong. -He is?

119
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,120
I know he does.

120
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,600
But I think he has a super deep background.

121
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:44,080
-I like that he does drama. -Tania?

122
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:46,240
Tania, thank you, thank you.

123
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:48,720
-Thanks you for giving me the answer. -Chill.

124
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,480
If it weren't for you, I would have flunked Philosophy.

125
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,600
Whatever I can do for a friend.

126
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,880
-But you got a D. -I don't care.

127
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,400
Lucky that she helped you.

128
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,720
Yes. I owe you one, cutie.

129
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,680
-Bye. -Bye.

130
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,560
Girlfriend!

131
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,360
-What if he wants something? -I don't know.

132
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,400
-He hugged you. -It's true.

133
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,892
Yes, but he hugged me to thank,

134
00:08:12,893 --> 00:08:14,440
not because he wants something else.

135
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:17,240
-Not with this hair. -Don't you like your hair?

136
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:19,960
-I know how to do haircut. -You do?

137
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,000
Yes, my aunt is a hairdresser. She taught me.

138
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,600
Come on. It's too boring at home.

139
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:26,560
-Take the chance. -Okay. Let's go.

140
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,920
But don't you overdo it.

141
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,160
-I don't want to scare him. -No. You will surprise him.

142
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,360
Okay.

143
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:38,560
He said he gave me a D plus, but I deserved a D.

144
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,360
As if he did you a favor. He got nerve.

145
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,036
You helped me study. How did he know?

146
00:08:42,037 --> 00:08:43,720
I repeated the lesson a thousand times.

147
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,480
Eudaimonia. "The myth of the cave." I knew it pretty well.

148
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,880
Men chained in a cave.

149
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:51,360
Yes, you knew it well. You deserved at least a B plus.

150
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:53,160
He laughed at my test in front of everyone.

151
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,800
Just because I made a stupid mistake, I don't know what.

152
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,285
I can imagine what tone he used.

153
00:08:57,286 --> 00:08:58,920
I don't know what you see in that teacher.

154
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,480
At first, friendly with the students.

155
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:02,240
When it's time to grade them, he forgets it.

156
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,628
-This time, he went overboard.

157
00:09:03,629 --> 00:09:05,000
-If I could, I would tell you something.

158
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,880
-Calm down. I won't talk to him. -No, I will talk to him.

159
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,000
Because, if it were you, what would you say to him?

160
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,280
Gerard told me you humiliated him in front of the whole class.

161
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,520
Sorry. I have never humiliated any student.

162
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,640
You laughed at his test.

163
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:23,878
He wrote that Aristotle and

164
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:25,680
Plato were father and son. That was funny.

165
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,400
Okay, I admit that it was funny. But he doesn't deserve a D plus.

166
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,920
He deserves a D, but I scored him higher.

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,600
I asked him the questions the night before and he knew them all.

168
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,897
-Plato, Aristotle, the cave.

169
00:09:33,898 --> 00:09:35,680
-He wasn't able to repeat it in the test.

170
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,960
I have never seen him study that much in his life.

171
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,880
He was aiming for the best mark. He was excited.

172
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:41,960
He deserves at least a B or a B plus.

173
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,411
Do you know what I think, Merli?

174
00:09:43,412 --> 00:09:45,040
The grade has something to do with us.

175
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,800
With us? Sorry, did I miss something?

176
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:50,520
You understand me. Because Gina doesn't say what I want to hear,

177
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,018
I won't give a good mark to her son.

178
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:53,200
Don't tell me that's not true.

179
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,480
Are you telling me that the grade I give Gerard

180
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:58,640
depends on whether I can hook up with his mother?

181
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,480
Yes. It seems so.

182
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,040
You can calm down. Gerard will have a B plus.

183
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,880
So fast? No, no, no. I want you to check the test again...

184
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,868
No. I will check it, but I

185
00:10:07,869 --> 00:10:09,440
tell you in advance that I will give him a B.

186
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:11,200
Now I have go to work.

187
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,960
Of course, even though I don't accept your interference,

188
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,560
you still turn me on.

189
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,480
-Tania. -What do you want?

190
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:27,720
-Hey, the other day, I was nervous. -So what?

191
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:30,600
-You said harsh things to me, too. -Now you're the victim?

192
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:32,880
-No, I don't play the victim, Tania. -No, no, bullshit.

193
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,160
Leave me alone.

194
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,440
Pol doesn't talk to me, neither do you. Am I really an asshole?

195
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,750
Look, today the fatso has a nice day.

196
00:10:40,751 --> 00:10:43,000
I'd rather be with people who respect me.

197
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,600
Leave me alone, will you?

198
00:11:02,520 --> 00:11:05,640
The beer is coming. Even though it was in the last minute.

199
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:13,120
Come in. Bye. There's food in the fridge.

200
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,320
If anything happens, call me. I'll come running.

201
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,400
Don't spend all day on the Internet. How is your cold?

202
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,360
-I'll turn up the heater. -What time do I give him the porridge?

203
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,400
What newspapers do you read on the Internet?

204
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
All of them.

205
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,120
Sport, too?

206
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:39,040
I hate soccer. I hate Bar?a.

207
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:41,440
They talk about it like it's important.

208
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,640
Do you have your idea about politics?

209
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,800
I think they should bring the guillotine back.

210
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,880
I don't understand why kings exist.

211
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,800
If we can put them up, we can eliminate them, too.

212
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:09,520
I'm sick of politicians who earn three times more than my mom,

213
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
who works all day at the bar.

214
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,680
I'm sick of the fucking TV. The more stupid, the more famous.

215
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,040
But if you have two jobs, you have to go abroad.

216
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,735
I'm well informed. I don't

217
00:12:21,736 --> 00:12:23,680
need to leave home to know what's going on.

218
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:29,000
Great. But it's necessary. Let's go.

219
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,680
What? No.

220
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,880
and you have to go out on the street and face reality.

221
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:39,040
You won't do anything to change the world from here.

222
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,840
-I don't want to change it. -It would be just for a minute.

223
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,600
You know Socrates spent the day going to the Agora?

224
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,000
Do like him. Learn from him.

225
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,600
I don't want to go out. Because I can't. Damn it.

226
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,400
What do you want?

227
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,840
You want to grow old isolated from society, like Kaspar Hauser?

228
00:12:58,200 --> 00:13:00,000
Or like the animals in cages?

229
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:02,320
I don't care what you say. I won't leave here.

230
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,800
Then, go to the psychologist.

231
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:05,760
Neither.

232
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:08,400
Your mother would prefer that you stayed enclosed in the cave.

233
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:10,560
Nothing happens to you. I don't feel sorry for you.

234
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:16,000
the more scared you get and the snowball will get bigger.

235
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,080
Don't tell me stories. I don't want to know anything.

236
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:24,720
Look at me.

237
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,800
Look at me, dammit.

238
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:32,080
I'll stick to you. Nothing will happen. No one will hurt you.

239
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,960
Just ten steps.

240
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,320
Then we come back home right away. Just ten steps.

241
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,960
Ten steps and that's it.

242
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:43,680
Do you trust me?

243
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,240
It is only fifteen steps to the tree.

244
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:01,440
-You said ten. -All right, ten. Little by little.

245
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:05,400
Try to lift the head and look forward. Come on. Head.

246
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:08,720
-I'm feeling sick. -We're almost there.

247
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,520
Calm down. Calm down. We're here. We're here. A little.

248
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,840
Come on, little by little. There's a step.

249
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:19,160
Be careful.

250
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:20,640
Coffee and cream?

251
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:23,120
Black coffee.

252
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,400
And water. Right?

253
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,320
Come on.

254
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:32,560
Excuse me.

255
00:14:34,520 --> 00:14:35,960
-Are you better? -No.

256
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,400
-What did you do? -Oh my, what a drag.

257
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,840
You took him out without my permission.

258
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,370
If I wait for your permission,

259
00:14:41,371 --> 00:14:43,160
your son will stay home for 30 years.

260
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,280
-How are you? -How do you want him to be? Intact.

261
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,120
Come, sit down.

262
00:14:50,520 --> 00:14:53,000
Calm down. Calm down. Wait a moment.

263
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,200
Who do you think you are?

264
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:07,960
How dare you take him out of the house?

265
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:10,320
Miriam, you're overprotective.

266
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,800
-Can't you see? -He's sick.

267
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,080
Was it not clear from the beginning?

268
00:15:13,081 --> 00:15:14,080
Is that how you help us, jerk?

269
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,960
If you don't let me do this, I can't help him.

270
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,720
Never come back to my house.

271
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:22,000
We're going home.

272
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,960
Come on. Easy. Calm down.

273
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,256
After what happened, we should

274
00:15:28,257 --> 00:15:30,000
be glad you were suspended for only thee days.

275
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,680
They understand it was a one-time thing.

276
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:35,360
-Joan made a mistake and was punished. -Not completely.

277
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,720
-You don't let me go out with friends. -With Pol and Bruno?

278
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,560
Are they your friends?

279
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,320
It's obvious that I can't let you hang out with that rabble.

280
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:44,760
Jaume.

281
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:50,640
-Are you having a test soon? -Yes, Philosophy.

282
00:15:51,640 --> 00:15:54,640
-Merli lets me do it after tomorrow. -Do you want more coffee?

283
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,320
-They speak very highly of Merli. -They do?

284
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:01,240
-He's the best teacher I have ever had. -Why is that?

285
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,520
Because...

286
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,480
Because he's funny. He explains things well

287
00:16:07,280 --> 00:16:10,280
and makes me like the subject. Everyone likes him.

288
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:14,960
-It's great, isn't it, Aurelia? -Of course.

289
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:18,800
It's nice to have a teacher who befriends the students.

290
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,960
No, no, we're not friends. He just teaches us.

291
00:16:29,160 --> 00:16:31,520
There'll always be a kid who doesn't pay attention.

292
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,720
But it's okay. No problem. Time is against you.

293
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,135
You read it and we'll talk later.

294
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:45,400
Thank you. What are you doing here?

295
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,960
-Hello. Shall we have dinner? -No, no, no and no.

296
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,280
I am working. You come, all of a sudden...

297
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,920
Okay. I do the same. But it's always about Gerard.

298
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,800
-Great. Are we having dinner or not? -No, no way.

299
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,720
You're going too far.

300
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:03,240
-I already told you no the other day. -No, you didn't say no.

301
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,520
I asked you if you liked me. And you didn't reply.

302
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:08,880
-To me, it was a yes. -You got nerve.

303
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,760
I thought we could celebrate Gerard's grade.

304
00:17:12,040 --> 00:17:14,840
You raised Gerard's grade so we can have dinner, right?

305
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:18,360
No, sorry, no. I didn't do it for that.

306
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:21,080
Besides, Gerard will ask me to fail him again.

307
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:22,840
Impossible. You already gave him a B.

308
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:23,920
-How would he... -You'll see.

309
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,680
He'll ask me to give him back the D.

310
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:28,680
Are you sure of what you are saying?

311
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,120
I don't know. I'm nervous. What do you want me to say?

312
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,720
Then, will we have dinner or not?

313
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:35,600
Not.

314
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,360
Have you kept this?

315
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,709
Don't trust him. For him,

316
00:17:39,710 --> 00:17:41,480
everything is relative. He's worse than me.

317
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,400
No, Merli. I've just ended a relationship.

318
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,680
No. Right. "And I'm not ready. I need more time for myself,

319
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:52,320
-I was hurt. I suffered a lot." -Yes, it's true.

320
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,080
All right, we'll see.

321
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,880
What are you doing?

322
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:04,080
-I'm going. -Yes, yes. Go, yes.

323
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:10,680
Goodbye, Merli.

324
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:02,800
"Socrates was Plato's teacher. He opposed popular ignorance

325
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,400
and those who considered themselves wise.

326
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,640
On the other hand, Socrates didn't consider himself wise.

327
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,800
He was a man who doubted everything.

328
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:13,080
Who cares what our parents put in our heads?

329
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,360
Do you agree with what you have received at home?

330
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,000
You are free to leave them behind."

331
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,200
Jaume.

332
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:44,160
Hey, have Toni come yet?

333
00:19:44,520 --> 00:19:48,080
-I don't know. Is there a problem? -Yes, with Merli.

334
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:50,920
I read some of my son's Philosophy notes.

335
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,320
Merli tells the students what they have to think.

336
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,760
-Jaume, I don't think so. -I don't care. I have to talk to Toni.

337
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,200
I think you'd better speak directly with him. He's over there.

338
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,360
-It's him? -It's him.

339
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,720
Hello.

340
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:10,800
Merli.

341
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,560
-You're Merli, right? -Yes.

342
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,560
I'm Jaume. Joan Capdevila's father.

343
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,240
Great. I have a few visiting hours.

344
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:21,640
Yes, I know. But I want to talk to you now.

345
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,640
Great.

346
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:28,080
Joan has been weird lately. Something happens.

347
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,440
The test thing. His performance is getting worse.

348
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,280
But I've read his Philosophy notes and I figured everything out.

349
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,094
You question the values learned at home.

350
00:20:38,095 --> 00:20:39,560
And that's indoctrination.

351
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,024
-Explaining Philosophy is indoctrinating?

352
00:20:42,025 --> 00:20:43,480
-Yes. Your way of explaining is.

353
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:46,240
You say what parents have taught them doesn't matter.

354
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:49,440
You gave him ideas that go against what we have planned for him.

355
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:52,520
Have you ever thought that eventually Joan has his own plans?

356
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:55,560
He's too young to decide. And you have nothing to do with it.

357
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,960
I just want the students to think freely.

358
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,240
And that freedom has led him

359
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:03,160
to the faculty room to steal a test copy.

360
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,221
He was suspended for three days for that.

361
00:21:05,222 --> 00:21:06,720
Forget about it. Turn the page.

362
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:07,887
I don't want to. I have

363
00:21:07,888 --> 00:21:09,920
forbidden him to hang out with his friends.

364
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,440
He has been punished here. Why do you have to punish him at home?

365
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:16,200
-You see? You don't stop teaching. -That's not teaching.

366
00:21:16,280 --> 00:21:18,320
I just wonder why you have to crush your son.

367
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,320
Don't you crush him by brainwashing him. Understand?

368
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,320
You asked what happens with Joan lately.

369
00:21:28,280 --> 00:21:29,480
I'll tell you what happens.

370
00:21:30,600 --> 00:21:31,840
He's happy.

371
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,080
He is happy.

372
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,800
-Yes, it looks great. -Yeah.

373
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:46,600
-Wow, girl. You look fucking great. -I do? You like it?

374
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,280
I have to give her credit. She sure has one hell of a house.

375
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,640
-Really? -Come on.

376
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,280
What is that girl's name?

377
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,560
-Monica. -Oh, right.

378
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:59,120
Monica, let's see when you can invite me and comb my hair. Okay?

379
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:00,280
Anytime.

380
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,920
My mother is a hairdresser, but I trust you more.

381
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,120
Look who's coming.

382
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:09,360
-Damn. What did you do? -Nothing.

383
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,800
-Wow, you're beautiful. -Yes, she is.

384
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:13,720
-Of course. -Not that much. I don't know.

385
00:22:13,800 --> 00:22:14,840
Monica helped her.

386
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:16,960
You could open a salon and get rich!

387
00:22:17,040 --> 00:22:18,520
Yeah. Sure.

388
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:20,120
Hey, handsome, we have Philosophy class.

389
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,200
Thank you. You are beautiful, too, Berta.

390
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,480
And you, Monica.

391
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,560
You three are natural beauties.

392
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:30,720
Man, I like how you recite Shakespeare.

393
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,000
-Thank you. -You do it really well.

394
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,520
Yeah, well... I have memorized many monologues.

395
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,240
Sure. Recite to me someday. Okay?

396
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:38,560
Sure. I like having audience.

397
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:41,680
Everything. Comedy, tragedy. Romeo, Juliet. Whatever.

398
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,480
-Julieta, Romeo. Eh? -Sure.

399
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:44,640
Sure.

400
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,920
He accused me of brainwashing his son. Oh my.

401
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,960
I just encourage them to have questions,

402
00:22:55,040 --> 00:22:58,320
so they can think by themselves. I accompany them, Toni.

403
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,600
Isn't it what we teachers should do?

404
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:06,360
-What? -Nothing. I used to be like you.

405
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:10,720
I was closer to the students. I wanted to encourage them.

406
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:12,840
I don't know. Eventually I lost energy.

407
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:15,960
And you've become a boring teacher.

408
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,200
I didn't say that.

409
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,160
But you think so, don't you? Do you think you are boring?

410
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,920
In any case, I'm respected.

411
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,160
If the kid doesn't want to go out, you can't force him.

412
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:33,760
Okay, we won't go to the street. I'm going. I have class.

413
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,720
Wait. What about Gerard's mother?

414
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:38,000
She came to visit you one day and the other?

415
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:39,920
-What is it? -Yes, a big question.

416
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,560
She demanded that I gave her son a B,

417
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:44,360
because he knew everything well at home.

418
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,000
-No? No? -Yes. Yes. No.

419
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,120
It's unbelievable, unbelievable.

420
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,720
What are we doing with the teaching, Toni?

421
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:53,760
I have dedicated myself to this for years.

422
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,000
What the fuck is happening that parents now dare tell a teacher

423
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,680
how he should teach or what grade he should give?

424
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,840
-Yes. -Someday, if I ask medical leave,

425
00:24:01,920 --> 00:24:03,600
it will not be because of the students, but of the parents.

426
00:24:03,680 --> 00:24:07,480
It's for shit. Gerard's mother demanded me a B.

427
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,160
because I want to take her son out of the cave.

428
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,200
Joan's father accuses me of corrupting his son. Dammit!

429
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,880
Herod was wrong. It was not the children that he had to kill.

430
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:18,280
It was the parents.

431
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,640
-Hello. -Hello.

432
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,920
-How are you? -Fine.

433
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:41,600
-Do you want to meet tonight? -I can't. I have things to do.

434
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,320
Pity.

435
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:45,800
But hey, maybe...

436
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,640
you could call me. If I have finished, we can meet.

437
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:51,880
-Okay. -Really?

438
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,000
Okay.

439
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,880
Hi.

440
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,560
You know that in the end, he gave me a B in the test?

441
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,640
He made a mistake?

442
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,000
Well, I'd say Merli demands more.

443
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:18,400
He sees I like Philosophy and he asks for more.

444
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:22,880
-He saw that I deserved a B. -Then, congratulations.

445
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,280
Quiet.

446
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,240
Sit down.

447
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:35,800
Okay, we were talking about Socrates.

448
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:39,360
Remember he was the one who was accused of putting

449
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,840
ideas into the young's heads,

450
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:45,200
when the only thing he did was ask them to question.

451
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,680
I asked you the same thing. Be distrustful.

452
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,680
What if we distrust you?

453
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:54,880
Great. Perfect. No problem. Distrust me, but it'll cost you.

454
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:58,120
All right.

455
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,080
When Socrates was told

456
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:05,800
he was the wisest among the Athenians, he doubted, too.

457
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:10,240
Then he asked other wise men what was knowledge.

458
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:11,880
And he saw they didn't have a clue.

459
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,200
And what did Socrates do?

460
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,520
He concluded that, at least, he knew he didn't know anything.

461
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,075
"I know that I know nothing,

462
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:24,240
but at least I know something." Clear?

463
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:27,200
Athens killed Socrates

464
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:28,267
because he was a pain in

465
00:26:28,268 --> 00:26:30,120
the ass who kept making irritating questions.

466
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,040
It's no surprise that Plato, one of his disciples,

467
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,480
distrusted the democracy,

468
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,360
which, as you know, was invented by the Greeks.

469
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,480
That's the problem we have today.

470
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,160
I mean, democracy is not perfect.

471
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,320
I won't answer you.

472
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,120
Wow.

473
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,800
What's wrong?

474
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:56,360
I've already given you the grade you wanted, a B.

475
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:01,640
But from now on, to me, it's as if you're not in the class.

476
00:27:04,440 --> 00:27:07,760
What system did Socrates use to make people find out

477
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,080
that they knew nothing?

478
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:10,640
Maieutics.

479
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:14,720
Maieutics.

480
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,240
-Gerard made a face. -Girl, I think he likes you.

481
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:25,080
He's talking to you all day. He's looking for you.

482
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:28,440
I noticed it. Just like you look for Marc, right?

483
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,400
In class, I don't hear anything.

484
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,040
I only think of him. Nothing else.

485
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,600
Hey, where is Berta?

486
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,400
I don't know.

487
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,640
-What's with you and Bruno? -He overdid it when he called me fat.

488
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,720
Yeah, guys are bastards.

489
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,480
Hey, someday, tell me your romantic stories.

490
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:49,120
Do you have a boyfriend?

491
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,600
Why don't we go inside?

492
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:00,880
Oh my.

493
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:03,760
-Tania. Tania. -Let me be.

494
00:28:12,840 --> 00:28:15,440
Merli, wait. I want to talk to you.

495
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:19,400
Merli. I want you to fail me.

496
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,960
Give me a D again.

497
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,040
I shouldn't have asked for a B.

498
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:28,595
In other words, you plan

499
00:28:28,596 --> 00:28:31,040
to leave the state "I want my mom to save me"?

500
00:28:31,680 --> 00:28:34,600
-Yes. -I didn't hear you.

501
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,600
-Merli, man. -Don't call me "Man."

502
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,240
Okay, I won't ask my mom to save me nor will I demand a grade.

503
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,040
Okay, you got a D.

504
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:48,200
But you're back in class like the rest of your classmates.

505
00:28:48,280 --> 00:28:49,280
Okay.

506
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,040
I don't like that most of you failed.

507
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:52,904
That's why those who flunked

508
00:28:52,905 --> 00:28:54,960
will have an assignment which serves as a test.

509
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:57,520
But everyone will do it to raise their grades.

510
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:00,560
Fucking great. Thank you.

511
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:11,080
My dad came to see you, didn't he?

512
00:29:11,800 --> 00:29:12,920
Yes.

513
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,240
I guess he didn't like your Philosophy notes at all.

514
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:18,800
Yeah.

515
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,560
Joan, I'm glad that you like my lessons.

516
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:27,320
And what we discuss in class makes you think about your life.

517
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:31,280
But the key is that you...

518
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:33,960
you don't know too well what you want your life to be.

519
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:37,160
But at least you know what you don't want.

520
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:40,320
I'm also not old enough to decide anything.

521
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:42,200
They make you think that?

522
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:46,640
-I don't know. My father thinks so. -No.

523
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,400
-I care about what you think. -Yeah, but...

524
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:54,720
-But what? -I'm not at the age to...

525
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,320
I don't know.

526
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,000
Come on.

527
00:30:02,360 --> 00:30:03,400
Look.

528
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,320
What is this?

529
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,160
-A bill. -How much is this?

530
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:12,280
Fifty euros.

531
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,080
How much is this now?

532
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:18,960
Fifty euros.

533
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,720
How about now?

534
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,480
-The same, 50. -Then you're like this bill.

535
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,023
No matter how many times you're

536
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:32,800
stepped on or crushed, you're worth the same.

537
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,400
And I think you're worth a lot.

538
00:30:36,920 --> 00:30:38,720
You're a Greek hero, Joan.

539
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,040
For you, I would sacrifice ten bulls

540
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:45,800
and organize the Olympic Games throughout the Polis.

541
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,160
All right.

542
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,360
Girl, I was told that you saw Marc and me.

543
00:31:16,440 --> 00:31:18,000
We kissed a little.

544
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,120
I didn't want to. I swear he approached me first.

545
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,400
Berta, you two were making out. And you know that I like him.

546
00:31:24,440 --> 00:31:25,624
Just two or three kisses.

547
00:31:25,625 --> 00:31:28,040
And I made it clear I don't want anything with him.

548
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,400
He wants it, but I refuse because I know you like him.

549
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,000
Berta, you're a bitch.

550
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:33,600
-Leave me alone. -Tania, really...

551
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:35,920
Berta, please, leave.

552
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,360
I told you Berta was unreliable. But you didn't listen.

553
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:49,960
Why do you care about what happened to me?

554
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:51,561
To you, I'm just a fucking fatso,

555
00:31:51,562 --> 00:31:52,840
just as you told me the other day.

556
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:53,960
Tania.

557
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:57,840
My mother says that to me, okay. But you? You're my best friend.

558
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,160
-I swear... -What?

559
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,400
-You're not fat. -Liar.

560
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:06,760
Lie. Yes, I am. Yes, I am fat.

561
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,120
I have flesh, I have fat. I have more fat than you.

562
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:11,760
It's not okay to tell a person who has fat that she isn't fat.

563
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,800
Because I am. I'm fat. And you compared me to that bitch Berta.

564
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,800
Okay. What do you want me to say? I don't know what you want.

565
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,080
Okay, you're fat. That's it. Happy now?

566
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,680
Yes, I'm happier.

567
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,680
Do you know what you are, man?

568
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:29,840
A fucking fag. A repressed fucking fag.

569
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,120
You won't ever have a guy

570
00:32:31,121 --> 00:32:33,040
because you're a coward and a hypocrite.

571
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,840
Look at me. You're a hypocrite, Bruno!

572
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,240
Fucking faggot, dammit.

573
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,800
Say goodbye and go.

574
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:52,840
I won't say goodbye to him because I will keep coming.

575
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:55,040
You don't understand anything. Go away.

576
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:01,200
You pity your son.

577
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,320
-And look at him like he's a weirdo. -Enough! Get out of here.

578
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:05,920
I don't pity him.

579
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,720
I reprimand him. I make him laugh.

580
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,760
And I downplay the anxiety attack that he had on the street.

581
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,920
Is that little for you? He vomited. He couldn't breathe.

582
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,080
-And he can't leave the house. -Until when?

583
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,760
Tell me. At what age would you let him leave the house?

584
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,480
Now it is too early.

585
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,840
What about you, Miriam? Have you looked at yourself?

586
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:26,360
From home to bar, from bar to home.

587
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,346
Do you do anything else during the day,

588
00:33:28,347 --> 00:33:29,960
apart from lamenting and working?

589
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:31,600
You're a pitiful soul.

590
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,280
Either both of us are positive and trust him,

591
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:49,240
or within a year we will have the same conversation.

592
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,840
You are isolated, imprisoned in your job.

593
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:58,680
But you're a beautiful woman and could take on the world.

594
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,680
Have some fun. Go out.

595
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,360
You're choked up at home, too. Free yourself from your child.

596
00:34:13,640 --> 00:34:14,574
And I assure you that

597
00:34:14,575 --> 00:34:16,800
eventually he'll go to school by himself everyday.

598
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:44,000
-Hi. -Hey, handsome. Lost your group?

599
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,200
-Are you Gina? -Yes.

600
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:48,600
A gentlemen told me to give you this.

601
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:55,000
-Thank you. -Good-bye.

602
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:00,520
I wait for you at the entrance of the flooded forest - m

603
00:35:43,800 --> 00:35:45,280
-You are not okay. -Hello.

604
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,040
I just saw a fish that looked just like your son.

605
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:52,240
Skinny, hectic, with the "Everything goes wrong with me" Face.

606
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,360
Are you making fun of him?

607
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:55,320
Like I said, he asked me to flunk him.

608
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:57,480
But he can do an assignment to raise his grade.

609
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,840
And that depends on us having dinner together?

610
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:01,880
For example.

611
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,080
Then flunk him.

612
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:06,560
Forget about Gerard for a moment. You and me are here.

613
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:08,823
You don't want dinner? Okay.

614
00:36:08,824 --> 00:36:10,640
I want to spend the afternoon with you.

615
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,292
Walking, strolling around the park,

616
00:36:12,293 --> 00:36:14,000
going around, then drinking something.

617
00:36:15,480 --> 00:36:16,840
Then come to my house.

618
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,400
You can't invite me to your house. You don't live alone.

619
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:20,921
No, Bruno is doing after school

620
00:36:20,922 --> 00:36:23,200
activity until evening and my mom goes home late.

621
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,560
I'm like a teenager who knows when the house is empty.

622
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
You always get away with it, don't you?

623
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,326
You sent a child to me with a message.

624
00:36:31,327 --> 00:36:33,280
No doubt you're not well in the head.

625
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:36,585
The one who's not well in the head is your ex.

626
00:36:36,586 --> 00:36:37,880
He left you for another woman.

627
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,600
Hello.

628
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:03,080
-What is it? -Open it.

629
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,720
A hundred pesetas.

630
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:23,536
The first payment of my father.

631
00:37:23,537 --> 00:37:25,440
He always kept it like a treasure.

632
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:29,920
And when I graduated law major, he gave it to me.

633
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,280
It was a symbolic prize for my effort.

634
00:37:35,120 --> 00:37:36,520
I want you to keep it.

635
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:39,600
I know that you will try as hard as your grandfather and me.

636
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,680
And you'll have your own lawyer office.

637
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:46,960
But...

638
00:37:48,040 --> 00:37:49,480
But what?

639
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,280
I don't want to.

640
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:55,720
What?

641
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:58,160
I mean...

642
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,400
I don't want to lose the bill.

643
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:05,040
I trust you.

644
00:38:08,280 --> 00:38:09,400
Keep it well.

645
00:38:10,720 --> 00:38:12,080
Will you do it?

646
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,000
-Enough. I had two. -So what?

647
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:37,720
I have to say this is not a real date.

648
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,760
No, of course not. It's a fake.

649
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:42,800
Excuse me.

650
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,520
Does your mother work?

651
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:52,520
Great actresses never retire.

652
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,240
-Actress? Who? -The Calduch.

653
00:38:55,480 --> 00:38:57,044
Carmina Calduch is your mother?

654
00:38:57,045 --> 00:38:58,760
I've seen her acting. She's great.

655
00:38:58,840 --> 00:39:01,080
-She's the best. -You didn't tell me that.

656
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:04,520
I want you to appreciate me for me, not for my mother.

657
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:09,120
You're an actor, too, a little. You sent the kid with a message.

658
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,720
If Gerard was as skillful as you are,

659
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:17,160
Yes. She's pretty. I think she smells nice, too.

660
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:19,520
Smell?

661
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,000
-Yes, women have a scent. -Men, too.

662
00:39:22,080 --> 00:39:25,720
But men are like wolves. All have the same smell.

663
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:29,680
No nuances. No. You women give off

664
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:34,080
a special kind of pheromone. A scent.

665
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:37,120
Come on. What scent do we have?

666
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:40,520
Sometimes, it's hard to know a woman's scent.

667
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:42,760
The perfume spoils it.

668
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,040
Like hot chocolate.

669
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,760
I don't want to keep up this conversation.

670
00:40:01,640 --> 00:40:03,360
Today I don't wear perfume.

671
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:38,760
Merli will return.

672
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,960
But we won't go out any more.

673
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,400
Until now, we were alone in this.

674
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:54,000
Merli is helping us. You wanted him to be your teacher.

675
00:40:54,080 --> 00:40:55,920
Inside the house, yes. Not outside.

676
00:40:56,200 --> 00:40:58,680
You saw how I was. I couldn't breathe. No.

677
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,000
I know. I know. But I want to ask you a question.

678
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:04,400
Are you better now than the day Merli came?

679
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,640
I'm terrible, mom. You and everyone can see that.

680
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,856
-You are not answering. Are you better?

681
00:41:09,857 --> 00:41:11,280
-I'm better here. At home.

682
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,960
Relaxed, no attacks, no fucking panic attacks.

683
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,040
It's a very simple question.

684
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,800
Are you better now than when Merli came?

685
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,760
Yes.

686
00:41:43,080 --> 00:41:44,680
Don't move. Don't move.

687
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:48,120
Stop, stop, stop.

688
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:54,080
-Macadamia nuts. -Macadamia nuts?

689
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:55,520
Come on, please.

690
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:58,400
You're Gerard's teacher and you're smelling me. It's surreal.

691
00:41:58,920 --> 00:42:02,280
It's not what teachers do with students' mothers.

692
00:42:04,400 --> 00:42:05,760
I'm going.

693
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:10,240
What are we doing?

694
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:14,160
Live, baby, live.

695
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,320
We were friends, or so I thought. I don't know.

696
00:42:36,680 --> 00:42:38,920
She wants me to believe that he started it.

697
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:40,680
She likes flirting around.

698
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:41,916
Yes. When a guy approaches her,

699
00:42:41,917 --> 00:42:43,520
she snuggles up to him until she fucks him.

700
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:48,160
You've been with many guys, right?

701
00:42:49,440 --> 00:42:54,200
Some. But I only had one serious boyfriend. That's enough.

702
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:55,760
What happened?

703
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,640
Nothing. I don't care, Tania.

704
00:42:57,720 --> 00:42:59,142
But if you care about your friend,

705
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:00,440
you should fix things with her.

706
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:05,080
Yeah, you're right.

707
00:43:06,920 --> 00:43:08,680
I'll talk to my best friend.

708
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,720
What a bitch! I went out on the street and Eugeni caught me.

709
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:26,880
The other day, you went overboard with Marc.

710
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,160
Someone hurt you and you keep silent. Who hurt you, Berta?

711
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:35,840
Merli is the master. No wonder he is dating the English teacher.

712
00:46:36,160 --> 00:46:38,800
-What? -Yes, with Laia. Pol told me.

713
00:46:39,080 --> 00:46:40,640
The one who's so gorgeous.

714
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,440
Yes, beautiful and super young. She could be his daughter.

715
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:46,560
What about we do the Philosophy assignment together?

716
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,040
Yes, I'd love to.

717
00:46:48,120 --> 00:46:50,560
Then tomorrow afternoon, I'm free and no one is at home.

718
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:57,480
Today you fuck her.

719
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,600
There's a new girl in class, right?

720
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:07,000
You like her?

721
00:47:10,360 --> 00:47:11,360
I'm shocked.

722
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:13,720
It's all right, Bruno. The world is full of fags.

723
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:15,080
Dad, you're crazy.

724
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:17,200
You shouldn't give a shit about what people think of you.

725
00:47:17,280 --> 00:47:19,640
Shut up, shut up! No, no!
